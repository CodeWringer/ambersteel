# Design Decisions
* Tactical, meaningful and non-arbitrary combat. 
    * Combat is lethal and characters can die, if they enter combat unprepared. 
    * Many tactical decisions to make. 
        * Most melee weapons allow the adoption of different stances, which affect the type of damage dealt, as well as the way the weapon is handled. 
        * Active combat skills. 
        * Co-operative skills. 
        * Defense is an active part, rather than a passive one. 
        * Wanton fights are discouraged. 
        * Fights will not occur at random and when they're not narratively justifiable. 
        * Wounds and crippling injuries. 
        * Armor has condition and can be worn down. 
    * Magic
        * Powerful, but risky. 
        * Magic is rare. 
        * Magic-users are arrogant, narcissistic, supremacist and tyrannical. Usually. Exceptions apply and are meaningful. 
        * Magic can be countered by a certain metal, allowing non-magic-users to stand a chance against magic. 
* Communication is key
    * Players must plan and coordinate together, before and during a fight. 
    * Role-play is rewarded and encouraged. 
* Resource management is critical for combat, but is also an aspect of role-play. 
* Sandbox
    * The players are encouraged to make special characters, within reason. Let them be heroes, but not for free. They will work for and be promised their heroism (or villainy). 
    * The world is a sandbox, the players can noticeably affect the world. The players' actions must have consequences, be meaningful and non-arbitrary. 
    * However, the world doesn't center around the players and will *keep spinning*, even in places they're not actively engaging in. The world is a living, breathing entity. 

# Ruleset
* Skill-Based (not level based)
    * Combat skills -> percentile dice
    * Non-combat skills -> dice pools
        * Skill challenges?
            * "Explain to me what skill you will utilize to chase this thief through the dark back-alleys..."
* Health -> Injury tolerance (not hit points)
    * Healing and regeneration takes time. 
    * Injuries must be tended to in a timely fashion, or they'll get worse. 
* Stamina
* Magic
    * Casting
        * Turn magic casting into layered skill checks?
    * Rarities

* Percentile dice
    * Modifiers have diminishing effects, unless they're huge modifiers. 
    * Smaller variants in the result are generally meaningless, becuase most values rolled are either far above or far below the target number (on average). 
    * Because all numbers have the same chance of coming up and only one roll is made, there is a high variance in outcomes. 
    * Poor at modeling routine tasks, because of the high variance allowing even a master to fail at something basic. 
    * Communicate the odds of success very transparently. 
    * Fast rolls, because only one number has to be compared to only one other number. 
    * Great for binary outcomes, where an action either succeeds or fails, but bad for determining degrees of success, as that tends to get very arithmetic-heavy. 
    * Players tend to take fewer risks, as they can easily assess the risk of failure. 
* Dice pools
    * Due to bell-curve distribution, at least one success is almost guaranteed. -> Low variance in outcomes. 
    * Great for degrees of success, where failure of an action is not expected, but rather its success and the only question is "how well did it succeed?"
    * Can suffer from the *bucket of dice* problem. -> Must be counter-acted through dice-upgrades. 
        * Past a certain level of skill -> +1 modifiers get added for each further level in the skill. 
        * Past a certain level of skill -> The target number for an outcome to count as a success becomes lower/higher, making success per dice more likely. 
    * Tallying up successes can be slow, especially when a lot of dice and modifiers are involved. 
    * Depending on the number of faces on the dice used, modifiers can have a huge impact. A +1 on a d6 can increase the odds of success dramatically. 
    * For the best experience, avoid less than 3 and more than 10 dice. 

* Combat skills
    * Overdrives
        * Action Surge -> Regain all actions (except for overdrive) this turn
        * Commanding Word -> Allow an ally another standard action this turn
* Double-wielding
* Combat -> Turns?
* Character creation
* Damage over time
    * Fire
    * Poisons
    * Other Toxins
    * Freezing
* Weapon / Armor quality grades

# Ideas

* Role-playing rewards
    * Let players reward other players' role-playing. 
    * Let the GM reward player role-playing. 
    * Let players acquire a resource by role-playing well and allow them to spend it in interesting ways. 
        * Let players make meta choices about the story.
            * Where does it go? 
            * Let them choose NPC backgrounds or aspects thereof. 
            * Let them create NPCs.
            * Let them auto-succeed at a roll.
            * Let them improve the odds of a success.
* Character creation
    * Life paths (see The Burning Wheel)
        * Help determine family, friends, enemies, reputations, property, etc.
    * Beliefs (see The Burning Wheel)
        * Personal goal / ambition.
        * Beliefs about members of the party.
        * Philosophical belief about the world.
        * Beliefs tie into the meta currency. 

## Improving
* No levels
* No classes
* Skills can be learnt and taught and must improve over time to unlock their full potential. 

## Determining success
* Dice pools. 
* The number of dice available is determined by skill. 
* Tests require a certain number of successes.
* Harder tests require more successes, easier tests require fewer successes. 
* Successes past the threshold count towards the level or degree of success. 

## Alternate health systems
* Wounds instead of HP? 
* Wounds on top of HP?
* Reduce attributes? Reach 0 in an attribute -> death

## Simplify weapon and armor stats
