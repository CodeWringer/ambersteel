# Bestiary
This compendium aims not to provide an absolute and complete guide to the **Ambersteel** universe's selection of non-playable creatures, but rather an overview of common creatures and a source of inspiration for custom ones. 

Not all creatures are incorrigibly hostile or voracious beasts, focused only on feasting. As such, travelers and adventurers may have interactions both combative or benign. 

There are a few categories of creatures, into which all creatures are grouped. 

## Beasts
Beasts are non-humanoid, often unintelligent creatures, without society or language, much like animals, but generally far more dangerous. Unlike [horrors](#horrors), they possess survival instincts and aren't necessarily hostile towards other creatures, unless they feel threatened or see intruders on their territory. 

Most notable examples of beasts are the family of griffons, such as the [royal griffon](beasts/griffons/royal-griffon), the [goatrend](beasts/goatrend), the [rust bug](beasts/rust-bug) or [harpy](beasts/harpy).

## Constructs
Constructs are animated objects, either through the power of steam, or through [soul-binding](../ruleset/magic/magic-schools#soul-binding). They lack free will and higher intellect, only able to fulfill menial tasks, as bid by their master. 

Most notable examples of constructs are the [titans](constructs/titans/titan). Less common examples are [gargoyles](constructs/gargoyle).

## Draconic
The grouping of draconics is reserved specifically for dragons and dragon-like creatures. 

Most notable examples of draconics are [primal dragons](draconic/primal-dragon) and [wyverns](draconic/wyvern). 

## Horrors
Horrors are terrifying and grotesque aberrations, like nightmares made material. Their existence is filled with pain, dread and unrelenting rage, which drives them to untamable hostility towards most other creatures. 

The origings of horrors are especially enigmatic, as most of them stem from the ill-researched [Creeping Death](../horrors/creeping-death) or the immoral experimentation of magic-users. 

Most notable examples of horrors are 

## Cursed
Cursed creatures represent an odd category. They're definitely magical in nature, but not persistently and against their will. Their condition is also generally inflicted upon them by mages or other cursed creatures. 

Most notable examples of cursed creatures are [werewolves](cursed/werewolf). 

## Humanoid
Diverse are the humanoid creatures that inhabit the world and just like the civilized people, the many uncivilized humanoids can be hostile or benevolent, plentiful or rare, intelligent or simple.

The differences are, that these are generally more animal-like creatures, rather driven by instinct than wit and that they lack well developed societies that could rival those of the civilized folk. 

## Magical
Magical creatures are of magical origin, which means they were created by mages during the age of magic. 

Most notable examples of magical creatures are the [Elder Tree](magical/elder-tree) and [shapeshifters](magical/shapeshifter). 

## Mundane
Mundane creatures are animals and insects that aren't particularly dangerous or different from their real-life counterparts. 

## Supernatural
Supernatural beings are ones whose nature and existence can not be explained. These are entities transcending time and perhaps even space. Their role in the universe is unclear and they may well be obliviously lost. Their very existence is anathema to the universe, every moment shrouded in drowsiness and pierced by unrelenting pain. 

Are they gods fallen from the heavens? Devils escaped from the hells? Escaped souls from the [Plane of The Dead](../world/plane-of-dead)? There may be no answer. 

The most notable example of supernaturals is [The One Who Spews Crimson](supernatural/The-One-Who-Spews-Crimson), although no one alive actually knows of its existence. 

## Undead
The undead are another type of [soul-bound](../ruleset/magic/magic-schools#soul-binding) creature, although the difference is that instead of an otherwise inanimate object, a once-living creature is reused. 

Depending on the capabilities of the creature's body, it may be possible to create autonomous and thinking creatures. 

Most notable examples of undead are [liches](undead/lich), [vampires](undead/vampire), [revenants](undead/revenant) and [zombies](undead/zombie).
