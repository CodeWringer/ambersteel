## Origin and Presence
The Krossovessians are one of the elder races of the old world. 

They inhabit any areas near or bordering on larger bodies of water and can be found on almost any island out on the ocean, provided the sea around is safe enough for their frequent migrations. 

Krossovessians are a nomadic species and tend not to stay in the same place for longer than a few years. 

## Physical Traits
They are humanoids. Compact, broad and covered in thick a carapace, Krossovessians are very tough, resilient and unyielding creatures. 

They have a high pain tolerance and can even regrow lost limbs over the course of a few years. 

They are aquatic creatures, but lack gills. Instead, they have a very efficient oxygen processing, meaning they can hold their breath for up to several hours. 

They lack eyelids, but instead have a translucent membrane that covers their eyes to protect them from outside atmospheric influence. Additionally, they are quite adept at seeing and navigating dark areas. For their great migrations, they require this ability, as they often wander parts of the shallower ocean floors, where little light reaches. But when an underwater landbridge cannot be found, they are forced to swim the distance.  

They are flexible enough to get around on land, although their tough and rigid carapace renders their dexterity one of their weaker attributes. 

### Diet
Unsurprisingly, Krossovessians primarily eat fish, smaller crustaceans and other aquatic prey animals. When on land, they will generally hunt for and overpower other, land-based predators. 

Perhaps less well known is that they will also ingest certain fruits or vegetables found on land. 

### Appearance
Krossovessians are up to 1,6 meters tall. 

While they generally don't have a concept of clothing, they will often times distinguish themselves by covering their carapaces in water resistant paints. They get fairly creative to make their carapace stand out from the crowd. From plainly colored to striped, dotted or intricately patterned is all possible. 

### Lifecycle
Krossovessians become up to two hundred years old. 

They reproduce very slowly, only having few offspring every few decades. 

## Magic
Magic isn't quite familiar to Krossovessians. Whether there are magically capable members of their species is unknown, but if there are, most of them choose not to show it.
