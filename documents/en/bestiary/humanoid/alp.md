# Alp
Alps are nightmarish humanoid creatures, blamed for bad dreams and night terrors. 

The Alp is a predator. Yet it preys not not flesh, but on raw fear itself. For this reason, it often encroaches on civilization, where it causes streaks of never ending nightmares for the people. They can take this spiel so far as to drive their victims insane. Suicides in villages haunted by Alps are not uncommon. 

## Appearance
These hunched humanoids are pale and haggard. Their face is featureless, devoid of eyes or mouth. Sometimes, horns protrude from the sides.

## Origin


## Occurrence
Alps are a fairly common occurence throughout the old world. How they reproduce is a bit of a mystery, though it is assumed to be related victims taking their own lives. In a way, the Alp's condition might be carried like a self-perpetuating curse.
