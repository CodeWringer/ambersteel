# Flying Carpet
This creature earns its peculiar name by its long flat body, shooting out of the water to pick sailors off ships. These predatorial monsters are covered in a dark, tar-like substance and their undersides are lined with hundreds of hook like legs. 

While they prefer the water, they can also be found on land, where they'll keep most of their body off the ground at most times, further reinforcing their name. 

A flying carpet is a terror of many a sailor and has ended enough to birth legends and myths surrounding it.
