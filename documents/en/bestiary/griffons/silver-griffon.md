# Silver Griffon
Silver griffons are nomadic avian carnivores. 

They're less aggressive than the other types of griffons, as they're nomadic and tend to avoid strongly contested territory. Also unlike the others, they travel in small groups, usually only up to five members strong, which is how they compensate for being much smaller and thus weaker than other types of griffon. 

## Appearance
The entire body is like a quadrupedal buzzard. 

Its name-giving plumage is of a shimmering silver color, which glistens blindingly in the sun light. 

They're the smallest variant of griffon. 

## Strengths
* Dangerous claws and beak
* Flight
* Fast

## Weaknesses
* Unintelligent
* Fragile

## Origin


## Occurrence
Due to their smaller size and thus smaller prey, silver griffons tend not to hunt farm livestock, which means they're far less of a nuisance to the civilized world. This means less resources are devoted to driving them away and thus silver griffons can even be seen inhabiting some of the less busy forests surrounding towns, cities and farm lands. 

They tend not to stay in one place long, only for a few weeks at a time, before moving on. This also means they're far less trouble than the more permanently settled down variants of griffon.
