# Primal Dragon
Primal dragons are the classic representative of the family of draconics. Large and proud, feral beasts, they are not to be trifled with. 

They'll gather a hoard of shiny things. It doesn't really matter how valuable the things they gather are, although most dragon hoards consist mostly of gold and jewelry. They're fiercely territorial and will defend their hoard with great ferocity. 

## Appearance
These large predatorial reptiles have large leathery wings that protrude from their backs and are covered in tough, dull colored scales. 

They have both forelimbs and hindlimbs, with the ability to grasp with their hand-like forelimb paws.

## Origin
They are some of the ancient creatures that have existed since long before the first human set foot on the [old world](../../world/world). 

## Occurrence
Most dragon have been driven from [old world](../../world/world) since the days of rampant magic, resulting in only few of them remaining. 

They prefer areas where they have ready access to both food and treasure. For their lairs they usually choose mountainous and out-of-reach locations.
