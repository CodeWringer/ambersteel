# Wyvern
Wyverns are a more primitive variant of dragon, driven by instinct, rather than wit. 

They also gather treasure hoards, but often less successfully than [primal dragons](primal-dragon). 

Being territorial in nature, once they've laid claim to a land, they will routinely patrol it and harry anyone who dares trespass. 

## Appearance
In appearance, they're very much like dragons, although smaller and lacking forelimbs. To compensate for the lack of additional claws, their snouts are longer and lined with larger, sharper teeth. 

## Strengths
* Strong
* Tough
* Can fly

## Weaknesses
* Unintelligent
* Conspicuous

## Origin
They are some of the ancient creatures that have existed since long before the first human set foot on the [old world](../../world/world). 

## Occurrence
Wyverns reproduce fairly quickly and are fare more wide-spread than most other draconics. This renders them a bit of a pest in most civilized lands, as they will often steal life stock and harass travelers in their territory.
