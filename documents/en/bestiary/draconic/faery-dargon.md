# Faery Dragon
These smaller variant of dragon possess a high intellect and natural aptitude for magic. They use these traits to avoid threats and stay hidden from the civilized world. 

Due to their elusive nature, only little is known about them amongst the human realms. 

They know well the dangerous and unstable nature of humans and tend to be most skeptical of them because of that. 

Like all draconics, they're enthralled by shiny things, like gold and jewelry, but respect others' property and won't knowingly steal. 

These are the least feral type of draconic, which manifests in their gentle nature and great curiosity. They enjoy watching people in their societies and love hearing stories. 

## Appearance
These dragons are comparatively small at about human height. 

Their scales shine iridescently, in a multitude of colors. Their eyes are just as colorful and shine softly. With much shorter snouts and more rounded faces, they resemble children both in appearance and demeanor. 

Instead of the typical draconic wings they have butterfly-wings that run the entire length of their body. 

They have both forelimbs and hindlimbs, with the ability to grasp with their hand-like forelimb paws.
