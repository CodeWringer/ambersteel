# Salamander

They're smaller than [wyverns](wyvern), but far more dangerous, because they have the ability to spew fire.

## Occurrence
Salamanders prefer colder climates, where their inner fire won't cause them to overheat as easily. They avoid open plains and instead prefer mountainous terrain, where it's easier for them to hide from unsuspecting prey. 

Due to the lack of ample food supply, they tend not to reproduce all too quickly and claim large territories which they're constantly patrolling.
