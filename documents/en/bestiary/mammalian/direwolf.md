# Direwolf
Much larger than a regular wolf, both mightier in physique and appetite, the direwolf is a commonly encountered carnivorous predator that tends to travel in packs. 

Fortunately for those unfortunate enough to meet one of these beasts, there is rarely enough room in a pack for more than one of them.
