# Basilisk
The basilisk is a large carnivorous reptilian, known to be a territorial ambush predator. 

Many a tale are spun to spook young children, with stories of their petrifying gaze. In truth, it is not their gaze, but their saliva that can paralyze its victims, but this is not widely known. 

## Appearance
A basilisk is a large reptilian, with four pairs of legs. 

Its large, tough scales are a dark shade. 

## Strengths
* Paralyzing poison spit

* Non-agile
* Weak maw

## Origin
