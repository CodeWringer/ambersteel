# Lie-Stalker
This unsightly creature is a peculiar one. Few remember their encounters with it and even fewer remember what it was capable of. 

It is not a strictly predatorial creature, as its victims do not directly come to harm, when it attacks. 

It is also known by the name **Forget-It-Not**. 

## Appearance
A ball of eye-stalks that sits atop a body of tentacles. 

## Strengths
* Magic
  * Can alter the mind of its victims to make them forget it exists. 
  * Can create illusions that make itself unnoticeable. 
  * Can make victims attack each other or serve it. 
* Can see in every direction. 
* Poisonous needles on the tentacles. 

## Weaknesses
* Fragile
* Weak
* Cowardly
* Cannot hear

## Origin
It is rumored that the lie-stalkers are the result of magic experiments of the bygone era. They might have been intended for use as spies, hiding in plain sight. 

Others say they are created when the winds of magic flow in just the right way to twist and morph an unborn child into this horrible monster. 

## Occurrence
These creatures aren't common, but can with much greater likelihood be found in ancient ruins and decayed places of the age of magic.

### Forget Me (Arc)
* Level 4
* Opposed by Resist
* MST
* 2 AP

This creature automatically makes itself forgot by those that look into any of its countless eye-stalks. Creatures that are made to forget about the lie-stalkers presence cannot fathom the idea that it even exists. <br> 
The victims get to try and resist the effect at the start of their turn during combat or once every minute out of combat. 

### Serve! (Ora)
* Level 4
* Opposed by Resist
* ST
* 2 AP

Any single creature can be targeted by this magical influence on the mind. If the victim fails to resist, it must serve the lie-stalker's command, unquestioningly. <br>
During combat, the victim gets to try and resist once at the start of their turn. Out of combat, every minute.
