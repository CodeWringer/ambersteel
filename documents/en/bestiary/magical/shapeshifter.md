# Shapeshifter
Shapeshifters, like their name implies, can assume the appearance of any other creature about their size. 

Most shapeshifters are harmless and wish only to lead a normal life in whatever society they choose. But there are also some that use their special ability for their own benefit, to sow chaos and confusion and benefit themselves. 

## Appearance
In their natural appearance, they're amorphous oozes. 

They consider their natural appearance so hideous that they'd rather never acknowledge it and prefer to pretend they are whosever persona they've assumed. 

## Strengths
* Shape-shifting

## Weaknesses
* [Amberite](../../magic/amberite) can negate their ability to shape-shift and force them back into their natural shape. 

## Origin
It is assumed that the original shapeshifters were created during the age of magic, to serve as infiltrators and spies. 

## Occurrence
They've been able to multiply slowly. For all intents and purposes, their physicality is exactly that of whatever type of creature they've shifted into. This means they can procreate normally, as other members of that species. Their off-spring will always be a shapeshifter, however. 

This also explains the slow rate of reproduction, as females discovering they gave birth to a hideous, amorphous blob will generally be terrified and try to get rid of the creature they bore. If discovered, they're also often shunned by the society they're part of. Fear and lack of understanding drives others to treat the female as cursed and will try to get rid of her and their *child*, either violently or by banishing them to an uncertain fate.
