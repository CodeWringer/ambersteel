# Sanguinara
The Sanguinara is a lower form of vampire, most beast than man, which feeds exclusively off blood. 

They're superhumanly fast and strong, with a ravenous appetite for blood, regardless of whose. 

Slaying these creatures may require considerable effort, but can be done without the application of [Amberite](../../magic/amberite). 

## Appearance
This creature takes the form of a grotesquely deformed humanoid, with long claws on hands and feet and multiple rows of sharp teeth lining their nightmarish maws. Their skin is pale and their eyes a dull pupil-less white. 

Their hunched-over body is covered in hair-like fur, across the head and back. Usually, the hair color is a dull, rust-brown red, unless if they've just fed, in which case it almost glows in a strong, bright crimson. A Sanguinara with brightly glowing hair is to be approached with caution, for it has recently fed and become much stronger because of that. 

## Strengths
* Fast
* Strong
* Faster and stronger when just fed

## Weaknesses
* Can be slain with steel
* Unintelligent

## Origin
Sanguinaras are created, whenever a [higher vampire](higher-vampire) feeds with too great an appetite and no restraint, so that their victim expires during the feeding. 

## Occurrence
They generally dwell in remote or uninhabited locations, but always close to their victims. This may be in the sewers of cities, the outskirts of slums or the woods adjacent to villages and towns.
