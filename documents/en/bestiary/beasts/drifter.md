# Drifter

Nomadic herbivores. 

When they feed, they descend on a tree, long tendrils extend from the body and selectively pick leafs. The tendrils move the leafs to the mandible-like maw at the underside of the drifter. 

These creatures are generally considered harmless, but can be a nuisance to farmers, when they decide to feed on cultivated fruit trees or farm crops.
