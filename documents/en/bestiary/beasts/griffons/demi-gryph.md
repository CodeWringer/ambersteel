# Demi-Gryph
The demi-gryps are territorial avian carnivores. 

They feed on larger prey, usually preferring quadrupeds, like horses, sheep, goats and cows. This renders them a menace to farmers who keep livestock. 

Being fiercely territorial, they'll fight other larger predators and members of their own species, to keep them away.
