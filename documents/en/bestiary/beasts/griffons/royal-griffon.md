# Royal Griffon
The royal griffon is a territorial avian carnivore. 

Smaller prey won't do for them. They'll hunt anything at least as big as a cow or horse and may even target other predators, if hungry. 

Being fiercely territorial, they'll fight other larger predators and members of their own species, to keep them away. 

## Appearance
The entire body is like a quadrupedal great eagle. It loosely resembles a lion, with a large mane covering their necks. Their tail feathers have a wide span, giving them a distinctive shape in the sky, when viewed from below. 

They're larger than [demi-gryphs](demi-gryph) and present a significant and ferocious threat to anyone crossing their path.
