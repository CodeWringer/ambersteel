# Great Titan
The great titans were the crowning achievement of the mage-nations of old. 

## Appearance
They are huge constructs, often humanoid in shape, with the addition of angel wings, halos and other features that may make them appear like deities or angels. 

## Strengths
* Extremely strong
* Nearly invincible

One cannot hope to win a fight against them with anything less than a large army of [Amberantists](../../religions/amberantism) or a small army of mages and even then the chances of victory might be low. Avoiding them is the safest course of action, most of the time. 

## Weaknesses
* Very slow
* Unintelligent

## Origin
These constructs were created in the times of rampant magic, by the great magic nations. 

## Occurrence
Only one great titan is still known about. This is the [Destroyer of Vanava](). It remains there, in the vast desert of [Mebira](../../world/mebira/mebira), in the sand-covered ruins of the once great city of Vanava, from where it gazes menacingly upon all the travelers of the desert. Its thorned halo and crowned head are testament to its terrifying majesty, which can be seen for miles around.
