# Guardian Titan
The smallest and simplest type of titan are the guardians. 

## Appearance
These constructs can be as large as a two story house, but take a wide variety of shapes, often according to the surrondings they watch over. 

## Strengths
* Strong
* Tough

## Weaknesses
* Slow
* Unintelligent

## Origin
These constructs were created in the times of rampant magic, by the great magic nations. 

## Occurrence
As their name implies, they were exclusively employed as guards and watchers, protecting places and objects of importance. Now, they can still be found guarding ruins of [The Old Empire](../../../nations/historical/human/old-empire). 

Their numbers dwindle every other day, as adventurers and treasure-hunters dispatch them in their exploration of the ruins, but even so, there may still be thousands of them left.
