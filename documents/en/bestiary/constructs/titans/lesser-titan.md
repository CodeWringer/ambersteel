# Lesser Titan
Lesser titans served as tools of oppression and control. 

## Appearance
They are large enough to scale a city's walls, yet not nearly as massive as the larger variants of titan. They often came in the shape of great beasts or animals, to make them seem even more frightening. Most popular were draconic or aquatic themes. 

## Strengths
* Strong
* Tough
* [Runes](../../magic/runes)
* Relatively fast

They pose a significant threat to anyone who provokes them, although defeating them may well be possible, careful planning provided. 

These type of titan are often equipped with [runes](../../magic/runes) to cast fire and acid. They may also commonly be equipped with permanently active [runes](../../magic/runes) that allow them to float weightlessly. 

## Weaknesses
* Unintelligent

## Origin
These constructs were created in the times of rampant magic, by the great magic nations. 

## Occurrence
They were fairly plentiful back in the days of magic and often served army generals or city governors.
