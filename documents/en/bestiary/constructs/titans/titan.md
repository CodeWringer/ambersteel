# Titan
Titans are supermassive constructs, infused with hundreds of souls to animate them. They once served the most powerful mages of the world, during the times of the titan war. 

Those titans that weren't destroyed during that time, still roam parts of the [old world](../../world/world). Unwaveringly, they still fulfill the last orders given to them, before their masters perished more than a millenia ago. 

They will attack anyone who gets too close, as a self-defense mechanism. So even if they seem inert, they must not be underestimated. 

There are several types of titans, each fulfilling different roles, traveling different terrain and being of different size and capability.
