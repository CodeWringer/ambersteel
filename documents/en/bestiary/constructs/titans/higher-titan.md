# Higher Titan
Before the [great titans](#great-titan), the higher titans were the the most powerful and terrifying presences of [old world](../../world/world). 

## Appearance
These fairly large constructs can come in a variety of shapes, with draconic and aquatic themes being prevalent. 

## Strengths
* Strong
* Tough
* [Runes](../../magic/runes)
* Relatively fast

Pretty much all of the higher titans were outfitted with permanently active [runes](../../magic/runes) that make them float weightlessly. 

## Weaknesses
* Unintelligent

## Origin
These constructs were created in the times of rampant magic, by the great magic nations. 

## Occurrence
Among the better known instances of this type are the [Devils of The Ocean](), which are higher titans in the shape of giant kraken-monsters that roam the oceans. They have claimed countless nautical vessels, as well as sailors lives. Some of them wander the oceans, others remain in certain areas. It is due to them, that the other continents of the world could not yet have been discovered, as they had intercepted all exploration vessels until now. 

Another known higher titan is the [Giant of Worlds Edge](), a large humanoid construct that wanders the [World's Edge mountains]() and harries all travelers it sees.
