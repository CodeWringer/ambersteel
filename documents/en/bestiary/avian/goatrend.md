# Goatrend
A large carnivore that proves a common nuisance to not only sheep and goat herders, which earned them their name, but they're a general threat to people, too. 

They're territorial and lonely hunters. Their speed and brute strength serves them well in overpowering their prey. Even though their strong odor gives away their presence from far away, one should not underestimate how quickly they could close the distance.
