# Wargheist
An undead monstrosity, often raised by necromances in times of open war and intended to serve as unliving battery rams and terror weapons.

It towers high above any man, sewn together from a multitude of carcasses and reanimated for destructive purpose. 

## Strengths
* Strong
* Poisonous breath
* Deadly claws and fangs
* Terrifying

## Weaknesses

* Poor perception

## Origin
Wargheists are always created by a necromancer. 

## Occurrence
They're a common sight in a necromancer's army, as they represent the shock-troops of the army, tasked with breaking through enemy defenses.
