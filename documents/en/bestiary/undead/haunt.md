# Haunt
The haunt is a peculiar variant of undead. 

Haunts are beings of pure fear, hatred, anger and sorrow. They represent the emotion that permeated all throughout their life and will haunt the places most memorable to them. They may harm the living, deprive them of rest or vandalize their property. 

The most effective way to dispatch a haunt is to counter the emotion they represent. They're generally unreceptive to [soul-banishing](../../ruleset/magic/magic-schools#soul-banishing). 

## Appearance
It has no corporeal form, instead manifesting as a kind of volumetric shadow. Much like [revenants](revenant), they seem to escape [Plane of The Dead](../../world/plane-of-dead) independently. However, unlike [revenants](revenant), their origin lies not in unfinished business, but rather the business done unto them during their life. 

## Strengths
* Impervious to [soul-banishing](../../ruleset/magic/magic-schools#soul-banishing)
* Impervious to steel
* Impervious to [Amberite](../../magic/amberite)

## Weaknesses
* Untelligent, purely instinctual

## Origin
When the first haunt appeared, or how, is unknown. 

## Occurrence
Rare, but not uncommon, haunts appear wherever a life's tragedy culminates in an even more tragic death. 

They exist in whichever place they remember most and strongest during their life time.
