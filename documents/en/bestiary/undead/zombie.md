# Zombie
Zombies represent the lowest form of undeath. 

## Appearance
Zombies are generally just a decomposing shell, perhaps weeks old, that has been resurrected and thus reanimated. 

Their movement is sloppy and lacks any grace. It is apparent it takes them considerable effort just to move around, as they shamble and stumble, their jaw slack and their dulled eyes staring ahead vacantly. 

## Strengths
* Tough
* Dangerous in numbers
* Immune to mind effects

## Weaknesses
* Unintelligent
* Slow
* Clumsy
* Weak if alone

## Origin
Zombies are always created by a necromancer. 

## Occurrence
They exist wherever their master wishes them to be. Their conspicuousness makes it difficult for them to remain hidden, however. 

An experienced necromancer may be able to command entire armies of zombies.
