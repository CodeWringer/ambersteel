# Spine Thresher
Spine threshers are a very deadly variant of undead, that serve in a necromancer's army as capable terror units. 

## Appearance
Their bodies are made of twisted and melded bone. Their limbs are spindly and long and end in sharp, long claws made of bone. 

Horns protrude from the skull-like head and rows of sharp teeth line the jaw. 

Their spine extends to a bony tail that culminates in a lance-like spike. Razor teeth line the entire length of the spine and tail and small skinless wings extend from the scapulas.
