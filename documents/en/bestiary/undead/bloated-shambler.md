# Bloated Shambler
Bloated shamblers are grotesque, hulking masses of bloated undead flesh. 

## Appearance
They're a type of flesh golem, comprised of multiple bodies sewn together and filled with noxious, rotten air. With a vacant gaze through dulled eyes they waddle towards their goal, struggling to stay on their swollen feet. 

## Strengths
* Very tough
* Explodes on death
* Immune to mind effects

## Weaknesses
* Unintelligent
* Slow

## Origin
Bloated shamblers are always created by a necromancer. 

## Occurrence
Due to the increased complexity in their creation, they're not quite as numerous as [zombies](zombie), but still quite numerous, as they're a staple grunt type serf in any necromancer's army.
