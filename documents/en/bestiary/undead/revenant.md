# Revenant
A revenant is an undead creature of limited independent thought, which retains much of their intellect after death and thus makes for a formidable soldier. 

## Appearance
Revenants are reanimated bodies, that move with considerably greater self-control than [zombies](zombie).

## Strengths
* Intelligent
* Strong
* Fast
* Immune to mind effects

## Weaknesses
* [Amberite](../../magic/amberite.md)

## Origin
Usually, they're brought about by [liches](lich) and necromancers, to serve them as capable bodyguards.

It is also possible for revenants to rise on their own if particularly strong-willed individuals die before their business is concluded. It is unknown whether they escape the [Plane of The Dead](../../world/plane-of-dead) through their own strength or whether some outside influence ferries them back. 

## Occurrence
Revenants are most commonly seen guarding powerful necromancers, but may also rarely wander haunted places, where they seek to conclude whatever business they may have once had.
