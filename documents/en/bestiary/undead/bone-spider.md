# Bone Spider
Bone spiders are a particularly nasty type of undead, often employed by necromancers as guardians or scouts. 

## Appearance
As their name implies, bone spiders are an amalgamation of various different bones that come together to form the shape of a spider. 

Three skulls sit on its blobby body's front and two large fangs protrude from the center skull's jaw, which is also larger than the other skulls. 

Eight very long and thin bony legs carry the creature's weight. Their ends are sharpened, with little "hooks" of bone protruding from the side, which allows the bone spider to stick to any surface. 

## Strengths
* Can climb any surface
* Deadly
* Terrifying screech
* Rudimentary speech capability
* Immune to mind effects

## Weaknesses
* Fragile
* Unintelligent

## Origin
Bone spiders are always created by a necromancer. 

## Occurrence
Bone spiders appear wherever a necromancer wishes peace of mind. They keep intruders out and relay basic information to their master. They can also let out a horrible, loud screech that may alarm other nearby serfs.
