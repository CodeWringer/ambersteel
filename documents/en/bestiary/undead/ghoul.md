# Ghoul
A ghoul is a foul undead creature that dwells in graveyards and day-old battlefields, where they feed off the flesh of the deceased. 

They're generally seen as nuisances that defile the rest of the dead. When alone, they're not particularly threatening, but can prove quite dangerous in larger numbers. 

Ghouls are also fiercely territorial, driven by pure instinct to drive out any intruders. The exception to this rule is when there is a feasting ground, usually a fresh battlefield, where food is abundant. 

They're nomadic creatures, moving on whenever a feeding ground has been exhausted. Sometimes they move in packs, but most commonly, they migrate alone. 

## Appearance
They're squat creatures, with spotted pale skin. Their pathetic stature belies the threat they represent. Their long, gorilla-like arms are lined with bony spikes and sharp claw-like bones extrude from their fingers. While only stubby teeth line the jutting jaw, one mustn't underestimate the strength of this creature's bite, which can crush bone with ease. 

## Strengths
* Strong
* Fast
* Immune to mind effects

## Weaknesses
* Fragile
* Unintelligent

## Origin
How they come to be is a bit of a mystery. Some theories imply their creation during the age of magic, others that they were born in the [great wounds of the world](../../world/great-wounds). 

It is assumed either their bite or their excrements can transfer their condition, which manifests itself only a long time after death. This implies a steady stream of ghouls, as it is impossible to tell where they've been. 

## Occurrence
Graveyards, crypts and day-old battlefields. Anywhere death is common.
