# Lich
A lich is an undead creature, which is capable of independent thought and based on a former magic-user. Even in death, they retain their magic affinity and intellect. 

Slaying a lich permanently is a very difficult affair, as they can continue to persist even without a body to occupy. Through centuries of study, they usually master the art of [soul-binding](../../ruleset/magic/magic-schools#soul-binding) in a way that allows them to occupy virtually any body, without losing any of their abilities. Thus, the most common solution to a lich-problem is to seal them in a sarcophagus of pure [Amberite](../../magic/amberite), which prevents them from occupying a new body.  

If that isn't an option, the only way to be rid of a lich is to force its soul to the [Plane of The Dead](../../world/plane-of-dead) through [soul-banishing](../../ruleset/magic/magic-schools#soul-banishing). Such a procedure would require considerable strength of will on the magic-users part, however, as the lich will push against their soul with all its might, threatening to force it out of their own body. 

## Appearance
Depending on how old the lich is, they may just be a bunch of bones held together by their [soul-binding](../../ruleset/magic/magic-schools#soul-binding). 

They often prefer to wear opulent finery, crowns and other symbols of superiority and might. 

## Strengths
* Impervious to steel
* Mage
* Regeneration
* Perceptive
* Immortal
* Intelligent
* Immune to mind effects

These are very powerful creatures, capable of casting magic and [soul-binding](../../ruleset/magic/magic-schools#soul-binding). 

[Amberite](../../magic/amberite) is an effective material against their magical abilities, although it doesn't harm their corporeal forms particularly well. 

## Weaknesses
* Can be reverse **soul-bound**
* [Amberite](../../magic/amberite)

## Origin
Most liches are brought about through death-pacts of powerful magic-users that agree to resurrect one another after death, thus providing each other immortality. As such a pact understandably requires a great deal of trust between magic-users the number of liches that exist is very limited. 

## Occurrence
Liches are very rare and often centuries old. 

They prefer to dwell in remote fortresses, where they study the secrets of [soul-binding](../../ruleset/magic/magic-schools#soul-binding) and build an army of undead.
