# City Killer From The Deep
A huge aberration, terrifying through its sheer size alone and specifically bred by the [Creeping Death](creeping-death) to break through human defenses. 

One could not possibly hope to kill one of these things with conventional weapons. It could crush armies and even entire cities all on its own. 

However, like all of the [Creeping Death](creeping-death)'s creations, they are short lived, rarely surviving more than a week, before simply sagging down into a massive pile of lifeless flesh. 

## Appearance
Massive monsters, often resembling writhing, undulating masses of flesh and bone, almost like centipedes, but more like a stretched rib cage. 

## Strengths
* Enormous
* Very tough
* Impervious to fire - drowns flame in crimson creep
* Extremely strong

## Weaknesses
* Poor perception
* Unintelligent
* Slow

## Origin


## Occurrence
These aberrations do not occur naturally, but rather whener the [Creeping Death](creeping-death) needs to break a stalemate with the civilized world.
