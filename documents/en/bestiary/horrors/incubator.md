# Incubator
Incubators are disturbing growths that occur in the [Creeping Death](creeping-death). They are the source of other abominations. 

## Appearance
These growths tower high above the ground and the surrounding fields of Maw plants. From their tops hang bags of meat, within which other, more mobile horrors are grown, until ready to be released. 

Some have a single, large incubator sack, others several smaller ones. Larger incubators occur more frequently, the closer to the source one gets.
