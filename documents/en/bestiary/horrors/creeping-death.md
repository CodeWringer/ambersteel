# The Creeping Death
Hostile to all life, this aberration consumes all organic matter it touches, further fueling its cancerous growth. Only when starved of food, or combated with fire and magic, does its progress halt - for a time.

The closer to its source - the [Great Wounds of the world](../../world/great-wounds) - the denser, larger and more treacherous its growths become. 

In short - the Creeping Death is a nightmarish and otherworldy entity flooding [the old world](../../world/world) like a wave of liquid flesh. 

The world had lived with the Creeping Death for a long time, knowing this enemy since the mage wars. And the world had been keeping it in check successfully for just as long a time. But in recent years, something changed. For a while, the creatures spilling forth from the [Great Wound](../../world/great-wounds) became larger and tougher. That wave of stronger aberrations ebbed again, and inhabitants of [Berennia](../../world/berennia/berennia) thought nothing much of it. Odd behavior of an odd foe. That was all. 

But then, the earth shook and cities crumbled, as enormous, abhorrent monsters ascended from the deep. For lack of a better name, they were dubbed the [City Killers From The Deep](city-killer). They crushed the cities around the [Great Wound](../../world/great-wounds), and caused blind panic to spread throughout [Berennia](../../world/berennia/berennia). It took hold on the land, [incubators](incubator) used the freshly obtained organic material to further the ranks of the monsters. Since then, it has been spreading almost unopposed. 

The people of [Mebira](../../world/mebira/mebira) are now panicking, frantically searching for a solution to the Creeping Death, fearing the proximity of another [Great Wound](../../world/great-wounds) on their continent.
