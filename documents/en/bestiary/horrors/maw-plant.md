# Maw Plant
Maw plants are terrifying plant-like growths that occur in the [Creeping Death](creeping-death). 

These things will lash out and bite anyone or anything that comes near and should they succeed, will lash on and not let go, until their victim bleeds out and dies. They then proceed to engulf the victim and digest them. Whatever they consume is sent back towards the source of the [Creeping Death](creeping-death), where it fuels other growths. 

## Appearance
These bulbous growths are almost plant-like in nature. They're shaped like upside-down bells, the center filled with a gaping maw and several rows of jagged, crooked teeth, made of bone.
