## Occurrence
They're native to the [Ebony spires](../../world/ebony-peninsula/ebony-spires) of the [old world](../../world/world), but have also spread to cover [Berennia](../../world/berennia/berennia), [Irnolia](../../world/irnolia/irnolia), [Zaetrippa](../../world/zaetrippa/zaetrippa), as well as parts of [Wurgen](../../world/wurgen/wurgen) and [Veerdhart](../../world/veerdhart/veerdhart). 

When they find a source of metal to consume, they tend to multiply quickly and can easily become a great nuisance to the local populace.
