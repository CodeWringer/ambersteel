# Werewolf
Werewolves are a type of curse-bound creature. Feral and vicious, they are driven by insatiable hunger and rage. 

They take the worst from both man and wolf - the bloodlust and ferocity of a wolf, and the ruthlessness and cruelty of a human.

## Appearance
They resemble bipedal wolves. Red glowing eyes stare down unsuspecting prey, while crooked, nasty teeth snarl, their face ever-contorted by unnatural rage. 

Overall, they look emaciated and grotesque, with sickly skin showing through spots in their fur. 

Long and crooked, yet sharp and deadly claws line their hands and feet, often caked in dried blood and always ready to add layers of fresh crimson. 

The following morning, the affected often don't remember their nightly murder-spree. But signs of their deeds remain - torn clothes, the taste of iron and an inexplicable exhaustion.

## Origin & Occurrence
The origin of the werewolf curse is unknown, though in part rumored to stem from the [great wounds](../../world/great-wounds). 

What is known, however, is the fact that the curse is transferred via the bite or blood of a werewolf, while it is in its feral form. 

In their normal form, someone affected by the werewolf curse might not even be aware of their condition. It is only at night, when the full moon shows, that they transform into their horrible alternative self.
