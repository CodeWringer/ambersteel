# Crimson Cresendo
The Crimson Crescendo, also called the Bloody Circus, is an as yet unexplained phenomenon, that has been teffifying the civilized world for millenia. 

The phenomenon begins with the moon being visible and glowing blood-red, during the day, usually around noon. Shortly thereafter, a travelling band of performers enters the city or town. They play beautiful and strangely ensorcelling music, while the acrobats and the fool show off their skills to the crowd. Anybody who hears their song will have a hard time resisting its alluring pull. The wonder and beauty of the moment is unparalleled. 

Then, when everyone partakes in the music and starts dancing to it, that is when the tune changes and the mood takes a sinister turn. A wicked grin on their faces, the performers watch as their audience begins tearing each other's throats out, their hypnotic song forcing all who hear it to join in on the bloody show. 

With horror in their eyes, the performers keep playing, ever faster and with ever greater zeal, possessed by their own song. 

As quickly as it happened, is as quickly as it all ends. When the music reaches its peak, is when the last horrors occur. And then it all stops. An unnatural mist creeps into town and swirls around the plaza where they performed. When it lifts, they're gone, leaving the survivors to the aftermath of their waking nightmare. 

Should their curse ever be lifted, would the performers surely break under the weight of their sins.

## Origin
