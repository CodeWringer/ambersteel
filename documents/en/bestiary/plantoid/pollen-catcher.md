# Pollen Catcher
This plantoid has developed an insidious hunting technique and can catch careless travelers by complete surprise in an instant. 

## Appearance
In its neutral state, this creature is entirely inconspicuous, looking like any any old fern, with a central bulb of folded leaves. 

Once it's in feeding mode, the bulb will unfurl and reveal dozens of long thorns, like a nail bed. About a dozen prehensile vines will also unfurl and try to wrap around any victims.

### Pollen (Any)
* Level 6
* MST
* 3 AP
* Opposed by Resist

Spray a large cloud of pollen to cover an area of 18'/6m. Anyone who fails their opposed resist test, is then overcome with an undeniable desire to throw themselves onto the nail bed that is the plantoid's maw. And they have to try and do it, like they're in a drunken haze, but very clearly have to follow its call. 

### Vines (Agi)
* Level 2
* ST
* 2 AP
* Opposed by Melee Defence

The vines can be used to wrap around and grapple a victim and draw them closer. They are moved by 3'/1m at the start of every turn.
