# Kirlennian Empire
> "Many enemies have crashed against us, like waves against a cliff, but we stood fast and forever shall!" - Kirlennian Emperor Orbán Miklós I at his coronation. 

The kirlennian empire might only control a relatively small part of the old world but have claimed dominion over the new world, which they may well be able to enforce. 

Back in the homeland, violent energies stir. A war is brewing and unlike in the past, this time Kirland won't be on the defensive. 

Their military excellence and the brilliant strategist that is their emperor, Órban Miklós II, the Kirlennians stand a good chance of successfully invading large parts of the old world. 

## Magic
For centuries, the kirlennian emperor has kept a court mage on a short leash. Magic is seen as a tool that must be kept under strict control. 

As such, free mages do not exist. They all serve a lord and have mage-hunters keeping an eye on them. 

There is a library at the emperor's palace, where arcane knowledge is kept, open only to a select few individuals, hand-picked by the emperor. 

## City- and Landscape
Many kirlennian cities are built with very narrow roads and sturdy, multi-story buildings, that often feature crenellations and easily accessible roofs. Doors are reinforced and windows well above ground level, where it is harder to get to them. 

In general, most cities may resemble fortresses more than typical places of life and industry. 

Walls are made of solid stone and brickwork, with timbering only used for the higher stories of the buildings. Only few buildings feature improvised extensions. Roof shingles, if used instead of flat, sealed wooden flooring, are made mostly of a glossy, dark gray material, that may sometimes be painted red, orange or blue. 

Buildings are usually organized into blocks, surrounding small parks, where residents can find a well and space to relax or spar. Due to these blocks there are only very few accessible back alleys, as most are behind locked gates and doors. 
There may be extensions and gate houses within any larger city that bridge two such blocks. 

Breaking the narrow streets apart are large plazas, which are usually dominated by a single, large statue of a noteworthy and distinguished Kirlennian. Most civilian life plays out on these plazas. There are market stalls, entertainers, wells and fountains, as well as town criers. 

Many cities and towns feature fighting arenas, where anybody can join in one of many types of fights. Duels and group fights are common place. The use of actual weapons is not permitted. Instead, wooden weapons must be used. Whoever is knocked out first, or surrenders, loses. 

### Monuments
Many cities and towns feature large plazas with statues of noteworthy and distinguished Kirlennians, usually military officials who scored a military victory, killed or captured an important enemy or any other such achievement. 

Other monuments may be represented by temples and statues dedicated to one of the numerous deities that the Kirlennians worship. 

### Infastructure
Due to the narrow streets, congestion is likely to occur. The cramped streets are usually unsuitable to stage coaches or horse wagons and thus most goods must be transported on foot, which severly limits some professions, reliant on large quantities or very heavy raw materials, thus forcing them mostly to the edges of a city, where the city gates are closer. 

### Sanitation
As the streets are so narrow, it is forbidden to dump one's refuse out onto the streets and must instead dump it outside the city. As those far from the walls may not have the time, nor the desire to travel so far, it is not uncommon for servants to exist, whose sole purpose is the gathering and hauling of the refuse. They usually employ large wheelbarrows for that purpose and are fairly well-paid. There may also be instances of forced refuse-haulers. 

To care for one's personal hygiene, kirlennian citizens must have a bath in their own home. Due to limited space in the living spaces, it is not uncommon for Kirlennians to share a dedicated *bath room*.

There are often times many wells and fountains, as well as water throughs, where anybody walking past can get a drink, or wash their face and hands. 

Some of the larger cities may even have a sewer system, although this is a great rarity. 

## Education
Proper education is a privilege reserved for wealthy Kirlennians. Knowledge is mostly passed on by private tutors or through apprenticeships. 

Due to the large amount of time most Kirlennians spend with manual labor and military duties, only few would even have the time to spend in the pursuit of knowledge. 

However, the nobility has an exceptional amount of time and interest in the acquisiton of knowledge. Some may be intrinsicely motivated to learn, but most will pursue some ulterior and selfish motive. 

## Economy
As Kirland is an outside and isolated from its neighbors, it experiences very little trade. 

Most trade is domestic and the generation of wealth mostly focused around the production of goods and food. 

Therefore, the actual generation of wealth is quite limited. This is offset by the feudalistic system. Most of the populace works on the fields and is awarded only a meagerly pay, but also a space to live and a guarantee of protection. 

## Governance
### Type
Hereditary monarchy

### Head of state
The emperor represents the head of state and holds absolute power. 

Serving the emperor are the five co-princes, who each control a region within the empire. They are chosen by the emperor himself and must be part of the high nobility. 

Below the co-princes are the dukes, who hold dominion over the provinces. 

### Law and Order
Laws are whatever the local lord wants them to be, as long as they coincide with his liege's laws. It is also up to every local lord to enforce the laws. Since all kirlennians are already used to service, it is not uncommon for some of them to be picked for guard-duty. 

The narrow streets aren't patrolled particularly much, instead guards may be posted at certain major crossings, at gates, at state buildings and on most of the plazas. 

The wars of the past have forged a tightly-knit society that sticks together. Criminals exist, but many would think twice about stealing from the same town they grew up in, simply out of respect for the people they grew up with there. 

Foreigners should be wary of the city watch, as they tend to pick on foreigners and generally treat them poorly. 

### Military
Having fought many defensive wars, Kirland is well acquainted with warfare and its intricacies. The populace has grown tough, well accustomed to fighting foreign invaders. 

All citizens are required by law to undergo military training and to stay in shape through regular sparring sessions. Such sessions are organized locally, by appointed military officers serving in each garrison. 

Additionally, there is a periodic, time-limited military service. All citizens must spend one quarter of each year in active military service. There is a great logistical overhead that makes sure that this doesn't cause fields to lie fallow. People are only chosen, if it won't harm the local economy too much. 

Many settlements, even smaller ones, have at least a small local fort, where the garrison forces reside. This is especially true in the regions bordering neighboring states. 

There is great pride in every Kirlennian when it comes to their military and they are not afraid to show it. Many Kirlennians will wear their well-maintained and polished armor even during day-to-day activities, unless it would inconvenience them at work. 

Some wealthier Kirlennians may choose to wear face masks that depict their face in frozen sternness, in hopes to distinguish themselves on the battle field and be recognized for their martial prowess. This is especially true of the kirlennian nobility. 

While Kirlennian armies are mostly comprised of tightly packed formations of heavily armored infantry, they are usually accompanied by formations of very heavy shock cavalry. These cavalry men are comprised of the wealthy Kirlennian nobility and are feared far and wide. A charge of these cavalry will usually smash right through an enemy formation. 

Accompanying the infantry men are large and loose formations of crossbow men, wielding heavy war crossbows, that must be reloaded with a winch, which they do in relative safety behind their pavise shield. 

This combination of an immovable front line, death raining over the shoulders from the back lines and the shock cavalry either securing the flanks or smashing into the back of the enemy line, renders kirlennian armies very difficult to defeat on the field of battle. 

## Citizenship
While foreigners are tolerated in small numbers, during times of peace, it is virtually impossible for them to become kirlennian citizens. There is distrust towards foreigners deeply rooted in most Kirlennians that would never allow them to accept an outsider as one of their own.
