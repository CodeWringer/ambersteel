# Girniv
Capital city of the [Borytranian Chiefdom](borytranian-chiefdom).

## Cityscape
Several larger buildings dominate the city's center. They're multi-storied wooden buildings, each floor tiered and covered in a rounded thatch roof. Great wooden pillars, decorated in colorized carvings, give the whole structure strength. 

Cobbled roads surround these imposing structures and run along the main thoroughfares.
