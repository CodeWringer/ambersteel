# Borytranian Chiefdom
> We take what is ours! Just try to stop us! - What a typical Borytranian thinks about ownership. 

The Borytranian chiefdom tips the north-western edge of the [old world](../../../world/world), where it controls most of the ice-covered coastline. 

## Dominating culture
[Arnshyran](../../../species/human/cultures/arnshyran)

## Magic
Magic is despicable and only used by undignified weaklings. 

## City- and Landscape
There are only few larger cities. Multi-storied buildings are very rare and mostly take the form of a chieftain's grand hall or a fortress. 

Most Borytranian settlements are fairly small and buildings loosely placed. 

Buildings are partially built into the ground and are covered in thatch roofs that reach the ground, so that buildings have plenty of insulation and only offer little surface area to the biting cold winds. 

Near the coastal regions buildings are instead above ground, but covered in multiple layers of thatch and timber which help with insulation. 

Skillful carvings adorn structural pillars inside, where a hearth dominates the center. Benches and tables line the sides, facing the hearth. 

### Typical Services
Fighting pits or wrestling rings are a common sight. 

### Monuments
#### Grand hall of the high chieftain
In the capital city of [Girniv](girniv), there stands the greatest of all chieftain's halls. 

### Infastructure
Cobbled roads exist only in the largest of settlements. 

### Sanitation
Filth is thrown into the streets, where rain washes it down the soil. 

## Education
Knowledge is passed on orally, and often stays within the family. There is no public education system. 

## Economy
Most of Borytranian economy is based on the plunder they bring back from their raids. 

Asie from that, due to their affinity for the sea, their largest industry is comprised of fishers and whalers. 

Other industries exist out of necessity, but aren't noteworthy. 

## Governance
### Type
Hereditary monarchy

### Head of state
High chieftain

### Law and Order
Local chieftains rule over their settlement and can pass laws almost freely. However, the high chieftain can overrule them and enforce their own rulings. 

### Heraldry
A golden crown above the green [Serpent of Arn](../../../bestiary/beasts/sea-serpent), on a backdrop of a blue M-shaped wave on a light-blue background. 

### Military
There is no standing military in a traditional sense, however, every male Borytranian not too old to wield a sword will readily rise up to repel any invaders, when their high chieftain calls upon them. 

## Citizenship
Anybody with the strength to defend their property can become a citizen. 

There's also a caste of slaves, brought back from raids and forced to manual labor until they expire. 

## Religion
[Worship of the Great Serpent of Arn](../../../religions/serpent-worship)
