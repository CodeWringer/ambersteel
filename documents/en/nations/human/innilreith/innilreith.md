# Innilreith
> "Beware, you of mundane birth and life, you hypocrites and tyrants! Your era is over! Let your deaths be part of the glorious rejuvenation of the age of magic!" - Necromancer and lord over Innilreith, **Mengk Kovskidrany**, in an open letter to the kings and queens of the old world.

Innilreith is the land of mages and undeath, born from the green-flames of necromantic magic. 

## Magic
Magic can be cast freely and without repercussion in Innilreith. In fact, those who don't cast magic are seen as creatures of lower value, to be used as no more than an expendable resource.

Thus, there is a clear hierarchy in Innilreith. The mages enjoy greater authority than mundane folk and more powerful mages enjoy greater authority than their weaker peers. 

Magical prowess very much dictates social standing. 

## City- and Landscape
Aside from the near complete devastation of all major cities and towns, some places remain partially intact. Their appearance hasn't changed much from what they used to be before the rise of the undead, however, now one must get used to the omnipresent stench of decay, the sight of withering flora and the absence of natural fauna. 

There are also several fortresses, palaces or towers that the mages had erected, to serve as their seats of power. 

### Typical Services
All typical services that may have existed before undeath, have either ceased, are the bare minimum needed to survive or tailored only to suit the mages' needs.

### Monuments
Not lacking arrogance, the mages have erected plenty of statues in their likeness. Whichever subdued town you are in, the statues will let you know who's in charge over it. Often times, statues will stand on pedestals, engraved with texts like "Be welcome, all ye who wish to serve!" - a warning to their servants and other mages alike. 

### Infastructure
The old roads may remain, but no one to maintain them. Messages are carried either by courier-servants, trained birds or undead thralls. 

### Sanitation
Any sanitation that may have existed before, is now mostly polluted and falling into decay. Oppressive stench and rampant illnesses are ever-present.

## Education
Servitors are not required to know more than how to serve their master. They will either learn on the job, or be punished for failing. 

Lacking a public education system, servants rely on traditional forms of teaching their children, by doing so themselves. Provided, of course, they are not too busy serving. 

Mages on the other hand, may accept apprentices and personally tutor them. But generally speaking, mages do not help other mages potentially become more powerful. 

## Economy
Exploitation is the only industry left. Servants struggle to feed themselves, as the mages force them to work to exhaustion. Construction work, craftsmanship and simpler services still apply, but only to the desires of their master. 

## Governance
### Type
Federal autocracy

Land is separated into several *magedoms*, each headed by a mage. These mages must submit to the will of the God-Emperor. 

When the God-Emperor dictates a law, it is to be applied by all the other mages. Failing to do so draws the lords ire and they will enforce it. Laws in magedoms enacted by their local mages don't have to be consistent or agreed upon. 

### Head of state
God-Emperor

### Law and Order
Laws are, what the mages want them to be. Laws also change on a regular basis and on the mages' whims. 

### Military
Almost the entire military of Innilreith consists of the necromancer's army of undead. Aside from that, servants may be forced to fight or mages may step in themselves, in order to achieve their goals. 

## Citizenship

## Religion
If Innilreith had a state religion, it would be the belief, that magic and magical prowess is to be the sole arbitrator in the world. It must not be regulated, it must not be limited. The strong rule the weak.
