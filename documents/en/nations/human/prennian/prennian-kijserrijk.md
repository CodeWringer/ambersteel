# Prennian Kijserrijk
> "The Kijserrijk is the first and last bastion of civilization! So it has been and so it shall always be!" - Kijser Waldemar Priesner I in a speech at his coronation. 

The prennian Kijserrijk is the largest human nation and represents a world power, with vast resources at its disposal. 

## Magic
There haven't been free magic-casters in the Kijserrijk for several centuries. Magic is seen as a force of corruption and evil, that must be weeded out. Magic is the antithesis to peace and order, bringing out what's worst in man. 

## City- and Landscape
Prennian cities represent the prennian spirit, with many closely packed and orderly blocks of multi-storied buildings, separated by large, cobbled roads and broken up by clean, circular plazas. 

Bordering several blocks are frequent large plazas, often times with a central fountain, occasional flower pots and beds and caged trees, benches and space for market stalls. 

Many inner walls separate the older cities into large sections, indicating a city's age and expansion over time. Although the inner gates are rarely ever closed, when needed to, they can serve to isolate city districts from each other. This usually only happens to contain pestilence or prevent a fugitive's escape. 

Prennian buildings are often times white-washed and painted over, or just left plain, showing the bright stone that is often used in construction. Large windows are flanked by finely decorated balconies and many smaller statues and sculptures boast of the wealth of their owner to any passer-by. 

Especially bordering the large plazas are many settled-down traders, where one can find almost anything for sale, that isn't illegal. There are also occasional markets being held, when the caravans of travelling merchants stop by to offer their wares. Open markets are more of a rarity inside the larger urban centers, whereas they can be taken for granted in most smaller towns. 

Most prennian cities are equipped with a well-developed canalisation, which carries most filth outside the city walls. This leads to most prennian cities smelling far less than their southern counter-parts, but also provides the city with another set of maintenance troubles. Despite many grates and gates barring passage and infrequent patrols, do criminals and monsters find their way into the sewer systems, from where they stage their sinister acts against the citizens above. 

A common sight in prennian cities are libraries, schools and private learning institutions, some state-funded, while others require frequent donations to keep running. Entry is not always open to the public and may be limited to membership in a guild or particular group of people. 

**Every** prennian city has at least one larger bath-house, sometimes even several. These are places of cleansing and community. Entry is open to all, but the heated baths require a small fee to be paid at the entrance. 
Part of these bath-houses are not only the bath-chambers, but also additional atriums and often times a second floor, where comfortable seating arrangements invite to a casual afternoon. 

Covering the landscape are many fields, used in agriculture. Cutting through these fields are many country roads, but some main traffic roads exist, which may even be cobbled and linked to occasional guard houses and castles. 

Past the fields are dense, but tamed woods, beyond which lie the borders to no man's land and other kingdoms. 

### Typical Services

## Education
There is a compulsory school education for all young citizens. Taught is reading and writing, some basic math and an understanding of law. 

Children of wealthy parents may enjoy additional tutoring and can attend additional educational institutions. 

The larger cities often times have public libraries, funded either by the state or the guilds and wealthy merchants. 

Due to a good general education, paper has grown in popularity as a medium for communication. 

## Economy
The large Kijserrijk boasts a very well developed economy. Much trade flows to and from the Kijserrijk, but amongst the plentiful larger towns and cities in the nation. 

The merchant-caste is constantly growing in power. 

## Governance
### Type
Elective monarchy: The ruler is voted on by a select group of privileged individuals known as electors or elector princes/princesses. 

The electors are not voted into office. It is a hereditary right of theirs. 

### Head of state
At the head of state is the Kijser, who holds near absolute power of the Kijserrijk. 

His decisions can only be overruled by unanimous veto of the six elector princes, who're also the candidates for the throne. A majority vote decides who's going to be the next Kijser. 

The Kijser has absolute control over the capital of the Kijserrijk, the surrounding province, as well as any provinces they controlled as an elector. 

The other electors control the other provinces. Ruling under them is a wide range of feudal lords and nobility. 

### Law and Order
Especially in larger towns and all of the cities are many guard houses, barracks and even fortresses, where the city watch organize themselves, rest and train. There is usually at least one city watch for each district of a city. As an endeavour to keep a feeling of unity and appreciation for cooperation high, guards are often exchanged between districts, where they serve for a certain time, until being reassigned again. 

The streets are patrolled and known problem-quarters kept under close watch. A particularity of prennian city watch is that they're all equipped with police whistles. When a guard is attacked or chasing down a fugitive, they use the whistle to call for aid, or to lock down adjacent streets. Once a whistle goes off, many more cascade through the streets, encircling the criminals and then closing in on them. 
This is why criminals rarely act alone, as it is simply too easy to get caught. 

It is mandatory to carry a source of light on one's person, when travelling the city at night. Anyone caught without can be forced to pay a fee. 

Legal disputes are carried out in court, where citizens can dispute laws and rulings. 

### Military
Military service is mandatory for all male citizens of the Kijserrijk. Near the borders, even the women may be conscripted, in times of need. 

This results in every prennian citizen having undergone a basic military training and having their arms and armor at home, in case they are called upon. Anybody unable to afford their own arms and armor may have those given to them by the state, at the same time entering a contract that has them pay off the arms and armor over time. This can either be in the form of small payments, collected in addition to the regular taxes, or in the form of social work. 

During times of war, every citizen can be drafted into service by their feudal lord, who reports to the marshal. The old, sick and otherwise unfit for battle are exempt, but must either send a substitute or pay for the hiring of an appropriate number of men and their equipment. 

## Citizenship

## Religion
Prennians are fairly open-minded when it comes to the various religious practices. The well educated populace does not live in fear of gods and religious practicioners and look upon religion fairly objectively. 

The official state religion is [Amelianism](../religions/amelianism), although it's influence has shrunk significantly over the centuries. 

Additionally, the Kijser is well aware of the churches influence, historically, and wants to prevent the church from gaining anywhere near the power and influence it had only a few centuries ago. Also, the Kijser has mandated the church handle all social and welfare work. 

Aside from the many foreign practices brought along with trade, the Kijser only openly endorses [amberantists](../religions/amberantism) acting in the name of order, hunting down rogue magic-users.

## Technology
The Kijserrijk has spear-headed many inventions of recent history, boasting a clear edge over its rivals in terms of technology. 

Conventional weapons and tactics fail to stem the tides of corrupted and undead monsters. But recent discoveries may provide a break-through. Steam and gunpowder have just been discovered and the Kijser has shown great interest in their exploitation. 

So it is, that the world's first steam-powered and iron-hulled warship has recently left the capital's port. The first batch of mortars has been employed to the front lines and shown great effectiveness against the undead. 

## Military
With vast resources, comes a vast military. The Kijserrijk has a large standing army, as well as a wide-reaching feudal system which can raise another in short notice. 

The unrelenting war with the undead and the corrupted beasts has kept tested and tempered the Kijserrijk's soldiers. 

Their military is powerful and flexible. If there is an answer to outside aggression, the Kijserrijk has it.
