# Hive of the Wing
> "Few can be blessed with the magnificence of our winged queen. Such a wonderful mother is she. Such a blessing. May the other hives, too, receive such a blessing, when the time comes." - A common notion among Zakkids of the Hive of the Wing.

## Magic
Magic is cast freely and without prejudice here. Altough, magic cast to harm others is not tolerated and severly punished. 

## City- and Landscape
The hive of the wing is unique in that the vast underground systems break through the ground in the form of great Zakkid-made spires, that reach high to the sky all over their territory. Most of these spires have neither windows, nor entrances near the ground level. 

The greatest spire, at the center of their hive, acts as the queen's residence. It is connected to several smaller spires, where the servants and guardians live. Past the guardins are the egg chambers, where the yet unborn next generation of Zakkid are cared for. 

Other spires are utilized as observatories, where Zakkid watch the night sky, the constellation of the stars and the flow of magic. 

There are ancestor halls, where one can pay their respects to those who came before them. Unique to the hive of the wing is that the carapaces of the dead are displayed openly and wings of stone cradle and elevate them. The [white shells]() guard and tend to these halls, to make sure the dead remain in good shape and visitors don't grow too sorrowful. 

There are many smaller meeting halls, usually joining several hallways together, where Zakkid can come together when on break. A few great halls exist too, which is usually where the great events of the Zakkid are held. 

In the [scrubbing chambers](#Sanitation) - the equivalent of a bath house - workers help other Zakkids clean themselves, as Zakkids can't clean themselves fully, just on their own. The name stems from the fact that Zakkid don't enjoy water quite as much as mammals and so use brushes or sand to scrub dirt and grime off their carapaces, instead. 

There are many smaller sleeping chambers connected to the myriad of hallways that connect the hive. Similarly, many smaller guard posts are placed all over the hive. The larger guard posts are usually located at the entrances to the hive, as well as to the queen's chambers. 

The few artisan Zakkid that exist each have their own workshop chamber, where they and their apprentices work tirelessly to create various crafts of intricate and highly elegant design. Some weapon's crafters exist, too, although Zakkid only use weapons as a last resort. 

A squat spire exists, to the edge of their territory, where visitors from afar are welcomed. Venturing past that point is only allowed for them with a Zakkid guard entourage. 

Depictions [the great winged scarab]() adorn many entrances. 

### Typical Services

### Monuments
[The great winged scarab]() stands in the queen spire's antechamber. Common belief has it it watches over the queen and thus the hive. Its body is hewn from ebony, its eyes made of great red opals blaze like the fire of the mountains, complemented by bands of gold rolling down the carapace and completed by silver wings adorned with countless sapphyres. 

### Infastructure
A labyrinthian network of halls connects the multitude of smaller and greater chambers of the hive. 

Messengers hurry notes along, bringing orders from the queen and feeding back information about current goings-on. 

Countless workers haul raw materials, crafts, food, furniture and whatever else needs hauling. 

### Sanitation
There are usually several [scrubbing chambers](), where one can excrete their biological waste and be cleaned. These chambers are usually round in shape, with a water basin in the middle, inset into the ground. Waste water flushes down a hole in the center and fresh water rushes in through canals in the sides of the chamber. Workers at the entrances receive visitors and help them clean. 

Natural aquifers and cave rivers serve as water source. Workers operate the pumps that keep the water flowing, if necessary. 

## Education
Knowledge flows only from masters to apprentices. There is no public school system, as Zakkids instead rely on their own innate curiosity and drive to seek out new knowledge. 

Although Zakkid are intelligent and learn quickly, their knowledge of the outside world is limited only to what news travelers bring. 

## Economy
There is no export as there is no traditional economy. Instead, all of Zakkid efforts are aimed solely at keeping the hive alive. 

Whenever travelers from other nations come by, they are open to trade, but they will not go out of their way for trade to happen. 

Underground caves are hewn from the granite, as well as natural cave systems utilized to house the hive. Aquifers and underground rivers are used to keep vast underground mushroom forests alive, which serve as a source of food and construction material, as the hardened mushroom wood is quite durable. 

Fiberous mushrooms are used to weave a form of cloth, which is then dyed as needed. 

Various other crafts are made as needed, from furniture to other every-day items. 

## Governance
### Type
Semi-Hivemind and absolute Monarchy

### Head of state
The Queen

### Law and Order
Both [broken Zakkid](), as well as heinous non-Zakkids threaten the hive. Guards protect it against them. Law breakers are taken to the queen, who speaks their punishment. 

Generally, law isn't broken often, as Zakkid have no mind for criminal action, so a lower level law enforcement isn't really needed. 

### Military
There is a standing army of Zakkid who train for war every day. They hope the day never comes, but recognize war is ultimately inevitable, as the younger species never know where their ambitions must end. 

## Citizenship
Any Zakkid born into the hive is its member. Gaining citizenship as an outsider requires a great deal of trust to be built. If the queen deigns their deeds worthy of citizenship, she'll invite them to their introduction into the hive, if they desire it.
