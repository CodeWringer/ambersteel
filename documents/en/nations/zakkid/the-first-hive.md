# The First Hive
> Being the oldest hive, presumed to be the origin of the Zakkid, they have braved any storm for millenia, keeping their species safe. 

## Magic
Magic is cast freely and without prejudice here. Altough, magic cast to harm others is not tolerated and severly punished. 

## City- and Landscape

### Typical Services

### Monuments
* The [great sarcophagus](), the first queen's place of final rest, is located inside a huge domed burial chamber. All along the walls, passages lead to the smaller burial chambers of the queens that followed since and the sarcophagi of their children fill the chambers. Every chamber has multiple levels to it, connected by several spiral staircases. Great chandeliers of iridescent crystal light bathe every inch in mesmerizing, yet sorrowful light. 
* The [ebony spear of king Karr'a'klak]() is a large ebony-made replica of the legendary weapon. It stands on a pedestal in the [great hall of the queen](). 

### Infastructure
A labyrinthian network of halls connects the multitude of smaller and greater chambers of the hive. 

Messengers hurry notes along, bringing orders from the queen and feeding back information about current goings-on. 

Countless workers haul raw materials, crafts, food, furniture and whatever else needs hauling. 

### Sanitation
There are usually several [scrubbing chambers](), where one can excrete their biological waste and be cleaned. These chambers are usually round in shape, with a water basin in the middle, inset into the ground. Waste water flushes down a hole in the center and fresh water rushes in through canals in the sides of the chamber. Workers at the entrances receive visitors and help them clean. 

Natural aquifers and cave rivers serve as water source. Workers operate the pumps that keep the water flowing, if necessary. 

## Education
Knowledge flows only from masters to apprentices. There is no public school system, as Zakkids instead rely on their own innate curiosity and drive to seek out new knowledge. 

Although Zakkid are intelligent and learn quickly, their knowledge of the outside world is limited only to what news travelers bring. 

## Economy
There is no export as there is no traditional economy. Instead, all of Zakkid efforts are aimed solely at keeping the hive alive. 

Whenever travelers from other nations come by, they are open to trade, but they will not go out of their way for trade to happen. 

Underground caves are hewn from the granite, as well as natural cave systems utilized to house the hive. Aquifers and underground rivers are used to keep vast underground mushroom forests alive, which serve as a source of food and construction material, as the hardened mushroom wood is quite durable. 

Fiberous mushrooms are used to weave a form of cloth, which is then dyed as needed. 

Various other crafts are made as needed, from furniture to other every-day items. 

## Governance
### Type
Semi-Hivemind and absolute Monarchy

### Head of state
The Queen

### Law and Order
Both [broken Zakkid](), as well as heinous non-Zakkids threaten the hive. Guards protect it against them. Law breakers are taken to the queen, who speaks their punishment. 

Generally, law isn't broken often, as Zakkid have no mind for criminal action, so a lower level law enforcement isn't really needed. 

### Military
There is a standing army of Zakkid who train for war every day. They hope the day never comes, but recognize war is ultimately inevitable, as the younger species never know where their ambitions must end. 

## Citizenship
Any Zakkid born into the hive is its member. Gaining citizenship as an outsider requires a great deal of trust to be built. If the queen deigns their deeds worthy of citizenship, she'll invite them to their introduction into the hive, if they desire it.
