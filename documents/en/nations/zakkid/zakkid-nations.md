# Zakkid Nations
This is a broad generalization of zakkid nations, as they mostly share the same traits. 

## Events
### Congregation of Skills
Every once in a while, not at regular intervals, but whenever enough masters feel they could take on new apprentices, a great competition festival is held, which takes about a week to complete. 

Every master competes against their peers, showcasing their skills, by completing various challenges or creating great works. Other Zakkids, who aren't masters yet, will watch attentively and once the week is over, will approach their prospective masters and apply as apprentices. 

Fresh food is served and drinks handed out freely. There is much talk and many new acquaintances made.
