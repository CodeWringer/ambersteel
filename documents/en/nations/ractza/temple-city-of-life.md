# Temple City of Life
> Here, where the gods touched the earth, they blessed the world, allowing life where the earth never wanted it. This temple both harnesses and basks in the gods' holiness, and so do we. - High chieftain Taal'imar at the inauguration of the Temple of Life

## City- and Landscape

### Typical Services
* Hot open-air baths - Stone-set pools, built over naturally occurring geysers. 
* Dream-chambers - Domed stone buildings, containing pools of water, disturbed by small waterfalls on the side or the center. The shine of submerged glowing crystals creates a play of light on the domed chamber ceiling. This is a place where Rac'tza spend time in silent contemplation, when troubled or stressed.
