# Nekhanian City-State
> We brave the sun's heat and the moon's cold, as the link between the two. 

The Nekhanian city-state was founded and is governed by Maraji and stands as one of the few place of Maraji autonomy in the world. 

## Culture(s)
[Maraji](../../species/maraji/cultures/maraji) comprise the majority of the populace, be they nobles or commoners. 

[Humans](../../species/human/humans) are also wide-spread, especially as merchants and mercenaries. 

## Magic
Magic is openly practiced, but restricted to non-harmful spells. 

## City- and Landscape
At the core of the city lies the large life-giving oasis. Its nigh indepletable waters are channeled for agricultural and sanitary use. 

Surrounding the oasis is soil, strangely uncovered by desert sand. This soil is highly fertile and unique to Nekha. The Maraji consider it an act of the sun's mercy to and a miracle. The soil and the oasis have been here long before the Maraji. 

### Typical Services

### Monuments
The largest sun plaza in existence is the opulent *eye of the sun*, where the high priestess herself performs special prayer duties. 

### Infastructure

### Sanitation

## Education

## Economy
Rare and expensive spices, as well as the world-famed desert-honey are products of Nekha. The soil is reinvigorated by the oasis water in a way no ordinary freshwater could achieve. There is a whole industry surrounding the nurture of flowers and bees that can survive the desert heat. Harming either the bees or the flowers is considered a punishable offense and the grounds where the bee hives reside is kept under lock and guard all around the clock.
