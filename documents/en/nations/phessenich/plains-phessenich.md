# Plains Irrilea
> "Never will we hunger again!" - Irrilean elder, as she planted their first crop. Since then, they have been hungry many winters. 

## Society
The plains Phessenich are a very tight-knit society, where everyone must help tend the crops they grow as their sole food source. 

Some are artisans, tasked with creating tools and weapons, as well as building huts and walls. 

The hardship of the path of survival they chose has shaped their society. There is little time for anything but tending to the few crops they can manage to grow. Hunger is a constant threat and many a winter has been very harsh on them. 

### Social Standing
Social standing is increased by helping others. The more members of the tribe one helps, the better they are regarded. 

### Magic
Magic is uncommon and strange to most Phessenich. Phessenich who are mages are revered and well treated, but also expected to serve the tribe. 

### City- and Landscape
Their village is completely surrounded by a wooden palisade and sections inside the village are also separated by wooden palisades, hinting at the growth of the village over time. 

Their huts are fairly low to the ground, made of driftwood, small logs and thatch. Surrounding every hut is a small moat, leading rainwater out of the village and towards the coast. 

### Education
Knowledge is transferred orally, from the village elders on to their younger peers. This is also true for farmers teaching other farmers and artisans teaching other artisans, and so on.

### Social Interaction
Plains Phessenich are just as social as the other tribes that surround them. Whenever they aren't working, they're socializing in some way or another. They love to cook and eat together. To that end they have dedicated huts for preparing food, as well as for sitting together. 

Especially in winter, when the crops don't grow and there is little else to do, will they perform music and dance or visit the other tribes. 

When looking for a mate, plains Phessenich will decorate their tails in whatever way they can. Painting it, sticking colorful feathers in the fur or draping strings of pearls over them. The more artful and flashy, the better. 

## Economy 
What little they produce, the plains Phessenich consume themselves. Despite this, they will sometimes trade with the other tribes, offering them tools and help with construction works in exchange for food or labor. 

## Governance
### Type
Oligarchy of the elders

### Head of state
Council of the elders

### Law and Order
Crime is a mostly unfamiliar concept to the Phessenich. Whenever someone slacks off, the other members of the tribe will scold them and get them to do their part, but serious crime is quite rare. 

Laws are generally decided upon by the elders of the village, with the eldest having the strongest voice. 

### Military
The concept of military is unfamiliar to the plains Phessenich, but they will all defend their home and their crops at a moments notice, if need be. 

## Religion
The Phessenich believe in several gods that are directly tied to the aspects of the world as they perceive them.
