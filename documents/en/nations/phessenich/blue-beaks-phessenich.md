# Blue-Beaks
> "How elegantly they soar through both sky and sea! One could get jealous..." - "But they are also weak and stupid. Unlike us." - Conversation between two plains Phessenich, as they watch  Blue-Beaks dive for fish. 

## Society
Blue-Beaks mostly keep to themselves, rarely freely mingling with the other tribes. 

### Social Standing
The elegance of one's flying and swimming affects how well one is regarded in Blue-Beak society. 

### Magic
Magic is uncommon and strange to most Phessenich. Phessenich who are mages are revered and well treated, but also expected to serve the tribe. 

### City- and Landscape
They live in simple huts made of driftwood and thatching. 

### Education
Knowledge is transferred orally, from the village elders on to their younger peers. 

### Social Interaction
They will commonly compete with each other, by racing each other or by performing daring aerial maneuvers. 

## Economy 
They mostly consume whatever they produce, but occasionally trade with the neighboring tribes. 

## Governance
### Type
Oligarchy of the elders

### Head of state
Council of the elders

### Law and Order
Crime is a mostly unfamiliar concept to the Phessenich. Whenever someone slacks off, the other members of the tribe will scold them and get them to do their part, but serious crime is quite rare. 

Laws are generally decided upon by the elders of the village, with the eldest having the strongest voice. 

### Military
The concept of military is unfamiliar to the plains Phessenich, but they will all defend their home and their crops at a moments notice, if need be. 

## Religion
The Phessenich believe in several gods that are directly tied to the aspects of the world as they perceive them.
