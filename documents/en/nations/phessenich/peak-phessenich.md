# Peak-Irrilea
> "A safe nest is the most welcoming place in the world." - A common notion among peak Phessenich. 

## Society
Safely perched on the mountain tops and the overhangs, the peak Phessenich feel safe from harm. 

They are the most curious of the Phessenich and will often go on long journeys into the surrounding lands, trusting in their ability to fly greater distances than the other Phessenich. 

### Social Standing
Social standing is measured by the amount of foreign wonders a peak Irrilean brings back home. Having a nest full of shiny and curious things is a great way to show off to the others. 

### Magic
Magic is uncommon and strange to most Phessenich. Phessenich who are mages are revered and well treated, but also expected to serve the tribe. 

### City- and Landscape

### Education
Knowledge is transferred orally, from the village elders on to their younger peers. 

### Social Interaction

## Economy 
They mostly consume whatever they produce, but occasionally trade with the neighboring tribes. 

## Governance
### Type
Oligarchy of the elders

### Head of state
Council of the elders

### Law and Order
Crime is a mostly unfamiliar concept to the Phessenich. Whenever someone slacks off, the other members of the tribe will scold them and get them to do their part, but serious crime is quite rare. 

Laws are generally decided upon by the elders of the village, with the eldest having the strongest voice. 

### Military
The concept of military is unfamiliar to the plains Phessenich, but they will all defend their home and their crops at a moments notice, if need be. 

## Religion
The Phessenich believe in several gods that are directly tied to the aspects of the world as they perceive them.
