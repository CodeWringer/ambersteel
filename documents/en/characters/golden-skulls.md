# The Golden Skulls
The Golden Skulls are a group of mercenaries, stemming from the Kirlennian empire. While at present, there are only three members left, they were at one point several dozen strong. 
They represent a highly sought after and well-paid band of sellswords, comprised only of elite fighters, trackers and sappers, ideally suited to difficult or confidential special operations. 

## Andrász István
Andrász comes from a family with a long tradition of military service in the empire. His father, as well as his father and his were each full time soldiers in the imperial army, who distinguished themselves and became officers. Times of peace don't agree well with him, which is why he joined the Golden Skulls. He impressed with his offensively minded and flexible tactics and fighting style.

## Míkail Bendegúz
Míkail is like the father of the group. He cares for the well-being of his comrades and deals with bureaucratic chores, such as negotiating and signing contracts. As the son of a lower noble he enjoyed private lectures that taught him reading and writing skills. 

He's very competent at holding the line and aiding his comrades. He either distracts or hits opponents when the opportunity arises.

## Zoltán Vass
Zoltán is the youngest member of the Golden Skulls and can consider himself quite lucky to still be alive. His tenacity and skill at evasion were key in his survival many times. He may come close to the abyss many times, but one thing is certain, he will always just narrowly dodge it when the last chance for it presents itself.
