# Types of tests

## Binary
Success or failure is absolute, with no room for interpretation. 

The skill or attribute to test is determined by the GM. 

## Graduated
Success or failure can be graduated. The level of success affects the quality of the outcome positively or the level of failure allows for a "failing forward" - a success, but with a complication, whose severity depends on the number of failures. 

The skill or attribute to test is determined by the GM. 

## Creative
Also known as a skill challenge, this type of test asks a player to pick and justify the skill(s) to use in a given situation. 

The GM must allow the use of the skill(s) in question, but does not dictate which ones to use. 

# Attribute test
1d20 <= attribute value

# Skill test
1d100 <= skill value

# Opposed test
