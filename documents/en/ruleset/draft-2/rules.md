# Introduction
**Ambersteel** is a role-playing game, requiring a **game master** (henceforth referred to as the **GM**) and at least one **player** to play. 

While each player only indirectly controls a single character, the **GM** is in direct control of every single non-player character (**NPC**), the world and the story. A player character is abbreviated as **PC**. 

The system is designed to fit a low to medium fantasy medieval setting. Player characters may be special, but they're far from heroic. Combat is deadly, magic is powerful, yet risky and character's abilities grow over time. 

But this is not an *antagonistic* game. The **GM** and the players work ***together*** to tell a compelling, interesting, humorous or tense story. Ultimately, the **GM**'s job is to provide conundrums to the players and their job is to provide answers. 

# Dice
**Ambersteel** uses a **dice pool** system of **six-sided dice** (henceforth referred to as **D6**). *Dice pool* means a variable number of **D6** will be rolled to resolve uncertain situations and actions in game. 

## Tests
Whenever the outcome of an action or situation is uncertain, a **test** may be called for by the **GM**, in order to resolve it. 

As a basis for a test, either an [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills) is used. 

Only a six rolled on a single die counts as a success. Other values are discarded as irrelevant. Only successes (sixes) matter. 

How many successes are needed in order to succeed a test, is determined by the **GM**, via the mechanism called **obstacle** (henceforth referred to as **Ob**). The test can only succeed, if at least as many successes are rolled, as the *obstacle level* named by the **GM**. 

> For example, to succeed a test at **Ob 3**, at least three successes must be rolled. Any less, and the test outcome is a failure. 

To resolve an **attribute test**, the number of **D6** indicated by the *attribute level* (the number next to the attribute) must be rolled. 

To resolve a **skill test**, the number of **D6** indicated by the **skill level** (the number next to the skill), plus the number of **D6** indicated by the related [attribute](#attributes) must be rolled. 

### Types of Test
There are the following types of tests. The **GM** decides when each type of test is appropriate. 

#### Binary Test
The outcome of the test is an absolute success, or failure. These are tests, where the **degree of success** is irrelevant. 

#### Stepped Test
A stepped test is really just a series of [binary tests](#binary-test). This allows for finer-grained results, while not behaving like a [graduated test](#graduated-test). 

This type of test is useful for situations where the **GM** decides to create very fine *time slices* and allow more chances for success. This makes it easier to allow a **PC** to *fail forward* or prevent a *one roll to end it all* situation. 

> For example, a **PC** is attempting to cross a suspension bridge, but upon setting foot on the bridge, the ropes holding it up, suddenly snap. The **PC** can make an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test, to try and quickly jump off and back onto solid ground. They fail, and get to make another [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test, to try and grab a root sticking out of the ground beneath the bridge. As a last chance for that **PC** to survive, the **GM** asks one of the other players if their character will attempt an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test to try and grab their falling ally's hand in a daring rescue. Finally, their ally succeeds and the **PC**'s life is saved. Obviously, such a situation should not arise often, as stepped tests can quickly grow exasperating for the players. 

#### Graduated Test
The outcome of the test is graduated. That means, the number of successes rolled during the test factor into the outcome. This is called the **degree of success**. 

> For example, when crafting a work of art, the number of successes achieved may result in a more impressive piece, which can then be sold at a higher price or which could make for a more impressive gift. 

On the other hand, failure doesn't have to be absolute. The degree of failure can allow for a "failing forward" - a success, but with complications, whose severity depends on the number of failures. 

#### Creative Test
Also known as a **skill challenge**, this type of test asks the player(s) to pick and justify the skill(s) and attribute(s) to use in a given situation. Players are encouraged to think creatively and come up with solutions. 

Whether the attribute(s) and skill(s) in question apply to resolve the situation at hand, lies at the **GM**'s discretion. 

#### Opposed Test
Also known as a *versus test*, this type of test occurs, when two characters come into opposition. Who wins, and by how much, is determined by comparing the number of successes of each character. The one with the most successes is the winner. 

If there is a tie, the defending character is considered the winner. 

> For example, a character tries to sneak past another, the sneak will have to do a [stealth](#stealth-agi) test, while the other character will have to do an [observation](#observation-perc) test. If the result is a tie, the one doing the observation test is considered the defender, and wins. 

If a tie occurs in which a defender cannot be clearly determined, the result is a deadlock and neither side gains anything. 

### Advantage & Disadvantage
Certain situations may warrant a character getting advantage or disadvantage to a test they have to make. 

Advantage grants **+1D6**, while disadvantage forces **-1D6** to the test in question. 

A player may argue for their advantage in a situation, but only once, with a clear statement. Dancing around, trying and hoping to somehow convince the **GM** with vague descriptions immediately disqualifies your character from getting advantage. Arguing with the **GM** *also* immediately disqualifies your character from getting advantage. 

### Providing Assistance
Characters can help each other in tests. In order to help with a test, a character must know the [skill](#skills) and the one being helped must accept the help. 

Helping in a test works much like [forking](#skill-forking) a skill. The character being helped receives **+1D6** to roll for each *character* helping them. The number of relevant skills a helping character has is irrelevant. Just one is enough to allow them to help and only one **+1D6** is granted by the helping character. 

If a **PC** is helping another, their player must describe *how* they're using their relevant skill to help. 

> For example, a **PC** is currently using their [thievery](#thievery-agi) to lockpick a door. Their allied **PC** is *helping*, by using their [observation](#observation-perc) skill to *keep an eye out for guards*, which allows the one on the door to work without having to constantly look over their shoulder. 

Ultimately, whether a skill is appropriate to help with is determined by the **GM**. 

# Character
A character is a representation of a sentient creature in the game world. They're an amalgam of [attributes](#attributes), [skills](#skills), [ambitions, beliefs & instincts](#ambitions-beliefs--instincts) and of course their [possessions](#possessions--equipment). 

### Time
Not all tests are created equal - some actions require more time than others. 

While the **GM** decides on how much time a given test will need, the following guidelines should provide a good basis. 

* (Near) instantaneous: Combat actions, recalling knowledge, noticing things in passing. 
* A matter of minutes: inspecting an environment, quickly skimming the contents of a book, persuading someone in conversation, first aid. 
* A matter of hours: Simple crafts, surgery, scrutinizing an environment, researching something simple/not obscure, engaging in lengthy and difficult negotiations.
* A matter of days and months: Complex crafts and artistry, researching a complex or obscure subject. 

### Fewer Tests Are Better
This section is primarily directed at the **GM**. The short of it goes as follows: 

Only have a player make one test per scene/situation, as long as the scene/situation doesn't change significantly. 

> For example, a **PC** is trying to sneak past two guards huddled around a campfire. If they succeed their [stealth](#stealth-agi) test, the **GM** lets them sneak all around the camp, without making them do multiple tests, as long as the situation doesn't change significantly. One of the guards getting up to take a pee behind a tree somewhere shouldn't be such a change, even if that happens to be the tree the **PC** is hiding behind. On the other hand, if the guards pick up torches and start actively looking for intruders, for whatever reason, then the situation changes significantly. Another [stealth](#stealth-agi) test would be warranted. 

Of course, how many tests are appropriate in a given situation is entirely the **GM**'s decision to make. 

## Attributes
Attributes describe a character's basic, inherent abilities. 

The value of an attribute indicates the number of **D6** to roll for a test of that attribute. Attribute values typically range from two to five for human characters. 

### Physical Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic physical abilities. 

#### Agility [Agi]
Determines how nimble, fast and flexible a character is. Any action that requires a character to move very precisely, will require agility. 

#### Endurance [End]
Governs how long a character can endure physical strains. 

For every point in endurance, a character raises their [Exhaustion Threshold](#exhaustion) by two. 

#### Perception [Perc]
Governs a character's ability to passively quickly pick up on fine and fleeting details in their environment or on objects and other characters. 

Also governs the ability to perceive under difficult conditions such as dim light and fog, or noisy and smelly environments. 

#### Strength [Str]
Governs a character's strength - the ability to lift, throw and break heavy and sturdy things. Such as skulls. Also governs the carrying capacity of a character. 

Each point in strength allows carrying one moderate and two light objects. 

Every two points in strength allow carrying one heavy object. 

#### Toughness [Tough]
Governs the [injury threshold](#injury) of a character. 

For every point in toughness, a character raises their [injury threshold](#injury) by two.

### Mental Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic mental abilities. 

#### Arcana [Arc]
Governs a character's ability to control magic flow, sense magic and withstand magic-exertion effects. 

Also used to resist negative magic effects. 

#### Intelligence [Int]
Governs a character's ability to reason and analyze. 

Also affects a character's speed of learning. 

#### Wisdom [Wis]
Governs a character's understanding of and ability to recall knowledge. 

### Social Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic social abilities. 

#### Empathy [Emp]
Governs a character's ability to read and understand another's emotions and intentions. 

#### Oratory [Ora]
Governs a character's ability to convincingly speak with and before others. Also used to manipulate others. 

#### Will [Will]
Governs a character's ability to withstand persuasion, intimidation, charm or terror. 

## Skills
A skill is any acquired knowledge and experience regarding a specific subject. 

All of a character's skills have a value attached to them, which indicates the number of **D6** to use when testing that skill. 

Skills can be improved over time. Every time a roll for a skill is made, the outcome will be noted. Whenever a certain threshold of successes and failures is passed, the skill improves. Both a certain number of successes *and* a certain number of failures must be accumulated to grow a skill. 

### Skill Forking
For every skill a character knows (= is not currently still learning), and they are currently testing a skill that is thematically related, they can **fork** that skill into their test, granting them **+1D6** for their test. 

> Imagine a large forked rivermouth. One of the forks feeding into it is also a large river, which represents the skill primarily being tested. The other, smaller forks of the river represent the supporting skills. They all combine together at the rivermouth. A primary and supporting skills flow together into the test! 

> For example, if a character is testing their [thievery](#thievery-dex--perc--spd) sill at level three and they also know [stealth](#stealth-dex--spd--int), they can **fork** their stealth skill into their thievery test. Any number of skills can be **forked** into a test, but each **fork** only grants **+1D6**. For the thievery test above, it doesn't matter if the character is at stealth level one or five or nine-thousand. They only get a **+1D6** to their thievery test. So in this case, if the **GM** agrees, the player gets to roll **4D6** for their test. 

Which skills can be **forked** into a particular test is up to the **GM**. If a player is performing a test, they can lobby for the use of the skills they want to **fork** into their particular test, but ultimately, if the **GM** says no, that decision is final. 

> Back to the thievery example. Let's assume a **PC** is trying to quickly unlock a door, because they're being chased by guards and desperately need to get away. They could argue to use their [stealth](#stealth-dex--spd--int) skill, but ultimately, what use is stealth when you've already been detected? Unless you can make yourself *unseen* somehow, the **GM** should rule that stealth cannot apply in that situation. 

### Intent & Action
The players drive the story and the action. When deciding on what to do, make sure you state the **intent** of your action, like "I will make that person work for us!". 

Then, the **GM** will need to know how you aim to follow up on your intent. Describe the **action** you will take. The clearer, the better. "I will tell them of our exploits and how well we get paid!", is a good response and allows the **GM** to conclude you're trying to [persuade](#persuasion-emp) the other character. Even better would be something like "I will *persuade* them by telling them of our exploits and how well we get paid!" That leaves no room for doubt *how* you wish to achieve your goal. 

Of course, how appropriate a certain skill is for the resolution of a given situation, is ultimately up to the **GM** and the specifics of the situation itself. 

### Skill List
The following list does not and cannot aim to be a complete listing of all possible skills in game. Adding new skills as necessary will have to be done by the **GM**.

### Learning Skills
Whenever asked to test a skill a **PC** does not yet know, it will be added or progressed in the *currently learning* section of the character sheet. 

A skill in learning can only be tested with their related [attribute](#attributes), at twice the **Ob** it would normally get. 

## Ambitions, Beliefs & Instincts
While all characters are expected to have ambitions, beliefs and instincts, **PC**s are special in that these concepts are cemented through rules and mechanics. 

Ambitions, beliefs and instincts can not change during a game session. They can only be changed in-between. 

### Ambition
Every **PC** must have at least one ambition - a life-fulfilling long-term goal to pursue, which is to be determined during character creation. This can be anything from "found a family" to "become king of the world!". No matter how unrealistic, an ambition is a primary driver for a character, to drive them onward. The important part is to think *big*. Something easily achievable would make for a dull ambition and defeat the point of it. 

An ambition is not expected to change often. An ideal ambition would last a character a long time. 

### Beliefs
A player also has to decide on three beliefs for their character, which represent short-term goals and expectations of the character and their player. A belief should not be a triviality, but instead a goal that requires some considerable effort on both the character's and player's part to achieve. 

Beliefs are expected to change frequently. 

### Instincts
Much like [beliefs](#beliefs), a player must determine three instincts for their character. 

An instinct represents an automatic reaction from the character, given a situation that triggers the instinct. They can be seen as "if/then" and "always/never" statements. 

> For example: "Whenever someone praises the state religion, I start ranting against it."

Ideally, an instinct should be (ab-)usable by the **GM**, to get the **PC** into *trouble* easier. This is to be taken with a wink, though. A **GM** is expected to craft an *interesting* story and thus create *interesting* conundrums for the players and their characters, with a realistic chance for the players and their characters to maneuver themselves back out of trouble. 

Instincts are expected to change frequently. 

## Exhaustion
Exhaustion is the measure of a character's maximum physical and mental strain they can endure. 

If a character's exhaustion reaches their threshold, they fall unconscious from extreme over-exertion. 

Exhaustion is gained through performing **exhausting actions**, carrying **exhausting equipment** or suffering [injuries](#injury). 

Exhaustion gained from **exhausting actions** can be reduced by resting. A full rest of at least six uninterrupted hours will fully clear any exhaustion gained from **exhausting actions**. 

Exhaustion gained from **exhausting equipment**, can be reduced, by dropping the equipment in question and resting for a short while, at the **GM**'s discretion. A character trying to carry more than they can endure, should not immediately fall unconscious, mind you. Apply common sense - the character in question would probably try to carry the extra equipment, only find out right away it is simply too much for them. 

## Injury
If a character is injured up to their **injury threshold**, they fall unconscious and arrive at [death's door](#deaths-door). 

Each time a character incurs an injury at or past half of their threshold, they must succeed a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test, or else lose consciousness. 

For every two injuries, a character's [exhaustion threshold](#exhaustion) is lowered by one. 

For every three injuries, the character suffers a penalty of **-1d**, to all tests. 

If injured past two thirds of their injury tolerance, a character must succeed a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test, or else suffer a [debility](#debilities).

### Recovery
To recover from an injury, a character must spend **Nd4** days in recovery, where *N* is the current number of injuries. 

### Debilities
A character accruing too many injuries may also suffer a debility, which may either be permanent, or at least stick around a long time. 

Debilities may affect a character's appearance, physical, mental and social abilities. 

### Death's Door
A character at death's door must succeed at least one [toughness](#toughness-tough) test out of a possible three. If they never succeed, they perish, irrevocably. If the character is at death's door during combat, they must roll their [toughness](#toughness-tough) test at the end of the player turn. 

A character can be helped out of death's grasp, via the use of medical arts or healing magic. A successful [medicine](#medicine-int--wis--perc) test is required. Forking is not possible. The character at death's door receives **+1D6** for each success. Alternatively, a healing magic test also grants **+1D6** for each success. 

## Possessions & Equipment
Money is generalized as **crowns**, with no regard for regional currencies. 

How much a character can carry, is determined by their [strength level](#strength-str). 

There are four weight levels: **Heavy**, **moderate**, **light** and **negligible**. A character can only carry up to a set number of heavy, moderate and light objects. An arbitrary number of negligible objects can be carried. 

Worn equipment, such as clothing, armor or backpacks do not count, for as long as they're worn. 

Technically, there would actually be five weight levels, the fifth being **too heavy**, which is anything that cannot be reasonably carried. 

> For example, an ordinary human will never be able to *carry* an entire mountain. They can carry smaller pieces (rocks), but not all at once. 

It is up to the **GM** to decide on when something is *too heavy* to carry for the character in question.
