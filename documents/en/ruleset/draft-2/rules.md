# Dice
**Ambersteel** uses a **dice pool** system of **six-sided dice** (henceforth referred to as D6). *Dice pool* means a variable number of D6 will be rolled to resolve uncertain situations and actions in game. 

## Tests
Whenever the outcome of an action or situation is uncertain, a **test** may be called for by the GM, in order to resolve the action or situation. 

As a basis for a test, either an [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills) is used. 

Only a six rolled on a single die counts as a success. Other values are discarded as irrelevant. Only successes (sixes) matter. 

How many successes are needed in order to succeed a test, is determined by the GM, via the mechanism called **obstacles**. For every **obstacle** in a test, a success must be rolled to overcome it. 

### Types of Test
There are the following types of tests. The GM decides when each type of test is appropriate. 

#### Binary Test
The outcome of the test is an absolute success, or failure. These are tests, where the **degree of success** is irrelevant. 

#### Graduated Test
The outcome of the test is graduated. That means, the number of successes rolled during the test factor into the outcome. This is called the **degree of success**. 

For example, when crafting a work of art, the number of successes achieved may result in a more impressive piece, which can then be sold at a higher price or which could make for a more impressive gift. 

On the other hand, failure doesn't have to be absolute. The degree of failure can allow for a "failing forward" - a success, but with complications, whose severity depends on the number of failures. 

#### Creative Test
Also known as a **skill challenge**, this type of test asks the player(s) to pick and justify the skill(s) and attribute(s) to use in a given situation. Players are encouraged to think creatively and come up with solutions. 

Whether the attribute(s) and skill(s) in question apply to resolve the situation at hand, lies at the GM's discretion. 

# Character

## Attributes
Attributes describe a character's basic, inherent abilities. 

The value of an attribute indicates the number of **D6** to roll for a test of that attribute. Attribute values typically range from two to five for human characters. 

### Physical Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic physical abilities. 

#### Dexterity [Dex]
Determines how nimble and flexible a character is. Any action that requires a character to move very precisely, will require dexterity. 

#### Endurance [End]
Governs how long a character can endure physical strains. 

For every point in endurance, a character raises their [Exhaustion Threshold](#exhaustion) by two. 

#### Perception [Perc]
Governs a character's ability to quickly pick up on fine and fleeting details in their environment or on objects and other characters. Also governs the ability to perceive under difficult conditions such as dim light and fog, or noisy and smelly environments. 

#### Strength [Str]
Governs a character's strength - the ability to lift, throw and break heavy and sturdy things. Such as skulls. 

#### Toughness [Tough]
Governs the [injury threshold](#injury) of a character. 

For every point in toughness, a character raises their [injury threshold](#injury) by two.

### Mental Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic mental abilities. 

#### Arcana [Arc]
Governs a character's ability to control magic flow, sense magic and withstand magic-exertion effects. 

Also used to resist negative magic effects. 

#### Intelligence [Int]
Governs a character's ability to reason and analyze. 

Also affects a character's speed of learning. 

#### Wisdom [Wis]
Governs a character's understanding of and ability to recall knowledge. 

### Social Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic social abilities. 

#### Empathy [Emp]
Governs a character's ability to read and understand another's emotions and intentions. 

#### Oratory [Ora]
Governs a character's ability to convincingly speak with and before others. Also used to manipulate others. 

#### Will [Will]
Governs a character's ability to withstand persuasion, intimidation, charm or terror. 

## Skills
All of a character's skills have a value attached to them, which indicates the number of **D6** to use when testing that skill. 

Skills can be improved over time. Every time a roll for a skill is made, the outcome will be noted. Whenever a certain threshold of successes and failures is passed, the skill improves. Both a certain number of successes *and* a certain number of failures must be accumulated to grow a skill. 

### Skill Forking
For every skill a character knows (= is not currently still learning), and they are currently testing a skill that is thematically related, they can **fork** that skill into their test, granting them **+1D6** for their test. 

For example, if a character is testing their [thievery](#thievery-dex--perc--spd) sill at level three and they also know [stealth](#stealth-dex--spd--int), they can **fork** their stealth skill into their thievery test. Any number of skills can be forked into a test, but each fork only grants **+1D6**. For the thievery test above, it doesn't matter if the character is at stealth level one or five or nine-thousand. They only get a **+1D6** to their thievery test. 

Which skills can be forked into a particular test is up to the GM. If a player is performing a test, they can argue for the use of the skills they want to fork into their particular test, but ultimately, if the GM says no, that decision stands. 

Back to the thievery example. Let's assume a player character is trying to quickly unlock a door, because they're being chased by guards and desperately need to get away. They could argue to use their stealth skill, but ultimately, what use is stealth when you've already been detected? Unless you can make yourself *unseen* somehow, the GM should rule that stealth does not apply in that situation. 

### Skill List
The following list does not and cannot aim to be a complete listing of all possible skills in game. Adding new skills as necessary will have to be done by the GM.

### Learning Skills
TODO

## Ambitions, Beliefs & Instincts
While all characters are expected to have ambitions, beliefs and instincts, player characters are special in that these concepts are cemented through rules and mechanics. 

Ambitions, beliefs and instincts can not change during a game session. They can only be changed in-between. 

### Ambition
Every player character must have at least one ambition - a life-fulfilling long-term goal to pursue, which is to be determined during character creation. This can be anything from "found a family" to "become king of the world!". No matter how unrealistic, an ambition is a primary driver for a character, to drive them onward. The important part is to think *big*. Something easily achievable would make for a dull ambition and defeat the point of it. 

An ambition is not expected to change often. An ideal ambition would last a character a long time. 

### Beliefs
A player also has to decide on three beliefs for their character, which represent short-term goals and expectations of the character and their player. A belief should not be a triviality, but instead a goal that requires some considerable effort on both the character's and player's part to achieve. 

Beliefs are expected to change frequently. 

### Instincts
Much like [beliefs](#beliefs), a player must determine three instincts for their character. 

An instinct represents an automatic reaction from the character, given a situation that triggers the instinct. They can be seen as "if/then" and "always/never" statements. For example: "Whenever someone praises the state religion, I start ranting against it."

Ideally, an instinct should be (ab-)usable by the GM, to get the player character into *trouble* easier. This is to be taken with a wink, though. A GM is expected to craft an *interesting* story and thus create *interesting* conundrums for the players and their characters, with a realistic chance for the players and their characters to maneuver themselves back out of trouble. 

Instincts are expected to change frequently. 

## Exhaustion
Exhaustion is the measure of a character's maximum physical and mental strain they can endure. 

If a character's exhaustion reaches their threshold, they fall unconscious from extreme over-exertion. 

Exhaustion is gained through performing **exhausting actions**, carrying **exhausting equipment** or suffering [injuries](#injury). 

Exhaustion gained from **exhausting actions** can be reduced by resting. A full rest of at least six uninterrupted hours will fully clear any exhaustion gained from **exhausting actions**. 

Exhaustion gained from **exhausting equipment**, can be reduced, by dropping the equipment in question and resting for a short while, at the GM's discretion. A character trying to carry more than they can endure, should not immediately fall unconscious, mind you. Apply common sense - the character in question would probably try to carry the extra equipment, only find out right away it is simply too much for them. 

## Injury
If a character is injured up to their **injury threshold**, they fall unconscious and arrive at [death's door](#deaths-door). 

Each time a character incurs an injury at or past half of their threshold, they must succeed a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test, or else lose consciousness. 

For every two injuries, a character's [exhaustion threshold](#exhaustion) is lowered by one. 

For every three injuries, the character suffers a penalty of **-1d**, to all tests. 

If injured past two thirds of their injury tolerance, a character must succeed a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test, or else suffer a [debility](#debilities).

### Recovery
To recover from an injury, a character must spend **Nd4** days in recovery, where *N* is the current number of injuries. 

### Debilities
A character accruing too many injuries may also suffer a debility, which may either be permanent, or at least stick around a long time. 

Debilities may affect a character's appearance, physical, mental and social abilities. 

### Death's Door
A character at death's door must succeed at least one [toughness](#toughness-tough) test out of a possible three. If they never succeed, they perish, irrevocably. If the character is at death's door during combat, they must roll their [toughness](#toughness-tough) test at the end of the player turn. 

A character can be helped out of death's grasp, via the use of medical arts or healing magic. A successful [medicine](#medicine-int--wis--perc) test is required. Forking is not possible. The character at death's door receives **+1D6** for each success. Alternatively, a healing magic test also grants **+1D6** for each success.
