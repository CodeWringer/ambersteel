# Introduction
**Ambersteel** is a role-playing game, requiring a **game master** (henceforth referred to as the **GM**) and at least one **player** to play. 

While each player only indirectly controls a single character, the **GM** is in direct control of every single non-player character (**NPC**), the world and the story. A player character is abbreviated as **PC**. 

The system is designed to fit a low to medium fantasy medieval setting. Player characters may be special, but they're far from heroic. Combat is deadly and magic is powerful, yet risky. The rules are designed to be as intuitive and simple as possible, while complex enough to allow players to make meaningful decisions. 

The aim of this system is to provide players with **decisions to make**, instead of *choices to pick*. 

Most rules will have a certain degree of vagueness to them. This is at least partially deliberate. The situations that can come up during play are simply too varied and numerous to be possible to completely cover with rules, without requiring epic tomes filled to the brim with highly specific rulings for highly specific situations. Instead, the game relies on the **GM** to arbitrate in every situation. The descriptions in the rules here should only serve as a point for orientation for the **GM**. How they interpret the rules, is how they're to be understood. 

But this is not an *adversarial* game. The **GM** and the players work ***together*** to tell a compelling, interesting, humorous or tense story. Ultimately, the **GM**'s job is to provide interesting conundrums to the players and their job is to provide interesting answers, in-line with what their character believes. 

Another important aspect of **Ambersteel** is that character's abilities grow over time. There are neither character classes, nor character levels. Skills and attributes improve as they're being used in tests. 

In some places, where distances are concerned, both feet and meters are noted as units. What attentive readers will notice, is that the conversion between the numbers won't always be correct. This is a deliberate decision to make the math easier, whenever a grid (or *battlemap*) is used in play. One square on the grid should represent either a five foot, or one meter square. Furthermore, a single, ordinary human, should occupy an entire such square. 

# Dice
**Ambersteel** uses a **dice pool** system of **six-sided dice** (henceforth referred to as **D6**). *Dice pool* means a variable number of **D6** will be rolled to resolve uncertain situations and actions in game. 

Also used in play are **three-sided dice**, abbreviated as **D3** and **two-sided dice**, abbreviated as **D2**.

## Tests
Whenever the outcome of an action or situation is uncertain, a **test** may be called for by the **GM**, in order to resolve it. 

As a basis for a test, either an [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills) is used. 

Either a **six** or a **five** rolled on a single die counts as a **positive**. Other values are considered **negatives**. **Positives** are required in order to succeed a test. 

The **positives** needed to succeed a test, is determined by the **GM**, via a mechanism called **obstacle** (henceforth referred to as **Ob**). The test can only succeed, if at least as many **positives** are rolled, as the *obstacle level* named by the **GM**. 

> For example, to succeed a test at **Ob 3**, at least three **positives** must be rolled. Any less, and the test outcome is a failure. 

To resolve an **attribute test**, the number of **D6** indicated by the *attribute level* (the number next to the attribute) must be rolled. 

To resolve a **skill test**, the number of **D6** indicated by the **skill level** (the number next to the skill), plus the number of **D6** indicated by the related [attribute](#attributes) must be rolled. 

For every test, one of three outcomes is possible: 
* Complete Success: There are enough or even more than required **positives**.
* Partial Success/Failure: There are not enough **positives**, but more than none. 
* Complete Failure: There are no **positives**, only **negatives**. 

### Types of Test
There are the following types of tests. The **GM** decides when each type of test is appropriate. 

#### Binary Test
The outcome of the test is an absolute success, or failure. These are tests, where the **degree of success** is irrelevant. 

#### Stepped Test
A stepped test is really just a series of [binary tests](#binary-test). This allows for finer-grained results, while not behaving like a [graduated test](#graduated-test). 

This type of test is useful for situations where the **GM** decides to create very fine *time slices* and allow more chances for success. This makes it easier to allow a **PC** to *fail forward* or prevent a *one roll to end it all* situation. 

> For example, a **PC** is attempting to cross a suspension bridge, but upon setting foot on the bridge, the ropes holding it up, suddenly snap. The **PC** can make an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test, to try and quickly jump off and back onto solid ground. They fail, and get to make another [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test, to try and grab a root sticking out of the ground beneath the bridge. As a last chance for that **PC** to survive, the **GM** asks one of the other players if their character will attempt an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test to try and grab their falling ally's hand in a daring rescue. Finally, their ally succeeds and the **PC**'s life is saved. Obviously, such a situation should not arise often, as stepped tests can quickly grow exasperating for the players. 

#### Graduated Test
The outcome of the test is graduated. That means, the number of successes rolled during the test factor into the outcome. This is called the **degree of success**. 

> For example, when crafting a work of art, the number of successes achieved may result in a more impressive piece, which can then be sold at a higher price or which could make for a more impressive gift. 

On the other hand, failure doesn't have to be absolute. The degree of failure can allow for a "failing forward" - a success, but with complications, whose severity depends on the number of failures. 

#### Creative Test
Also known as a **skill challenge**, this type of test asks the player(s) to pick and justify the skill(s) and attribute(s) to use in a given situation. Players are encouraged to think creatively and come up with solutions. 

Whether the attribute(s) and skill(s) in question apply to resolve the situation at hand, lies at the **GM**'s discretion. 

#### Opposed Test
Also known as a *versus test*, this type of test occurs, when two characters come into opposition. Who wins, and by how much, is determined by comparing the number of successes of each character. The one with the most successes is the winner. 

If there is a tie, the defending character is considered the winner. 

> For example, a character tries to sneak past another, the sneak will have to do a [stealth](#stealth-agi) test, while the other character will have to do an [observation](#observation-perc) test. If the result is a tie, the one doing the observation test is considered the defender, and wins. 

If a tie occurs in which a defender cannot be clearly determined, the result is a deadlock and neither side gains anything. 

### Advantage & Disadvantage
Certain situations may warrant a character getting advantage or disadvantage to a test they have to make. 

Advantage grants **+1D6**, while disadvantage forces **-1D6** to the test in question. 

A player may argue for their advantage in a situation, but only once, with a clear statement. Dancing around, trying and hoping to somehow convince the **GM** with vague descriptions immediately disqualifies your character from getting advantage. Arguing with the **GM** *also* immediately disqualifies your character from getting advantage. 

### Providing Assistance
Characters can help each other in tests. In order to help with a test, a character must know a relevant [skill](#skills) and the one being helped must accept the help. 

Helping in a test works much like [forking](#skill-forking) a skill. The character being helped receives **+1D6** to roll for each *character* helping them. The number of relevant skills a helping character has is irrelevant. Just one is enough to allow them to help and only one **+1D6** is granted by the helping character. Which skill is used to help with, matters, however. 

If a **PC** is helping another, their player must describe *how* they're using their relevant skill to help. 

> For example, a **PC** is currently using their [thievery](#thievery-agi) to lockpick a door. Their allied **PC** is *helping*, by using their [observation](#observation-perc) skill to *keep an eye out for guards*, which allows the one on the door to work without having to constantly look over their shoulder. The **GM** finds that description agreeable and allows the use of the skill to help. 

Ultimately, whether a skill is appropriate to help with is determined by the **GM**. 

#### Helpers Learn
A character helping in a test, also gains [progress](#advancing-skills) towards the [skill](#skills) they've helped with. If the character who was helped succeeded their test, the helper also gains a successful test to mark on their skill. 

# Character
A character is a representation of a sentient creature in the game world. They're an amalgam of [attributes](#attributes), [skills](#skills), [ambitions, beliefs & instincts](#ambitions-beliefs--instincts) and of course their [possessions](#possessions--equipment). 

### Time
Not all tests are created equal - some actions require more time than others. 

While the **GM** decides on how much time a given test will need, the following guidelines should provide a good basis. 

* (Near) instantaneous: Combat actions, recalling knowledge, noticing things in passing. 
* A matter of minutes: inspecting an environment, quickly skimming the contents of a book, persuading someone in conversation, first aid. 
* A matter of hours: Simple crafts, surgery, scrutinizing an environment, researching something simple/not obscure, engaging in lengthy and difficult negotiations.
* A matter of days and months: Complex crafts and artistry, researching a complex or obscure subject. 

### Fewer Tests Are Better
This section is primarily directed at the **GM**. The short of it goes as follows: 

Only have a player make one test per scene/situation, as long as the scene/situation doesn't change significantly. 

> For example, a **PC** is trying to sneak past two guards huddled around a campfire. If they succeed their [stealth](#stealth-agi) test, the **GM** lets them sneak all around the camp, without making them do multiple tests, as long as the situation doesn't change significantly. One of the guards getting up to take a pee behind a tree somewhere shouldn't be such a change, even if that happens to be the tree the **PC** is hiding behind. On the other hand, if the guards pick up torches and start actively looking for intruders, for whatever reason, then the situation changes significantly. Another [stealth](#stealth-agi) test would be warranted. 

Of course, how many tests are appropriate in a given situation is entirely the **GM**'s decision to make. 

## Attributes
Attributes describe a character's basic, inherent abilities. 

The value of an attribute indicates the number of **D6** to roll for a test of that attribute. Attribute values typically range from two to five for human characters. 

### Physical Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic physical abilities. 

#### Agility [Agi]
Determines how nimble, fast and flexible a character is. Any action that requires a character to move very precisely, will require agility. 

#### Endurance [End]
Governs how long a character can endure physical strains. 

For every point in endurance, a character raises their [Exhaustion Threshold](#exhaustion) by two. 

#### Perception [Perc]
Governs a character's ability to passively quickly pick up on fine and fleeting details in their environment or on objects and other characters. 

Also governs the ability to perceive under difficult conditions such as dim light and fog, or noisy and smelly environments. 

#### Strength [Str]
Governs a character's strength - the ability to lift, throw and break heavy and sturdy things. Such as skulls. Also governs the [carrying capacity](#carrying-capacity) of a character. 

Each point in strength raises the [carrying capacity](#carrying-capacity) of the character by three. 

#### Toughness [Tough]
Governs the [injury threshold](#injury) of a character. 

For every point in toughness, a character raises their [injury threshold](#injury) by two.

### Mental Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic mental abilities. 

#### Arcana [Arc]
Governs a character's ability to control magic flow, sense magic and withstand magic-exertion effects. 

Also used to resist negative magic effects. 

For every point in arcana, a character raises their [maximum spell intensity](#maximum-spell-intensity) by one and their [exhaustion resistance](#magic) by one. 

#### Intelligence [Int]
Governs a character's ability to reason and analyze. 

Also affects a character's speed of learning. 

#### Wisdom [Wis]
Governs a character's understanding of and ability to recall knowledge. 

### Social Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic social abilities. 

#### Empathy [Emp]
Governs a character's ability to read and understand another's emotions and intentions. 

#### Oratory [Ora]
Governs a character's ability to convincingly speak with and before others. Also used to manipulate others. 

#### Will [Will]
Governs a character's ability to withstand persuasion, intimidation, charm or terror.

## Skills
A skill is any acquired knowledge and experience regarding a specific subject. 

All of a character's skills have a value attached to them, which indicates the number of **D6** to use when testing that skill. 

Skills can be improved over time. Every time a roll for a skill is made, the outcome will be noted. Whenever a certain threshold of successes and failures is passed, the skill improves. Both a certain number of successes *and* a certain number of failures must be accumulated to grow a skill. 

### Skill Forking
For every skill a character knows (= is not currently still learning), and they are currently testing a skill that is thematically related, they can **fork** that skill into their test, granting them **+1D6** for their test. 

> Imagine a large forked rivermouth. One of the forks feeding into it is also a large river, which represents the skill primarily being tested. The other, smaller forks of the river represent the supporting skills. They all combine together at the rivermouth. A primary and supporting skills flow together into the test! 

> For example, if a character is testing their [thievery](#thievery-dex--perc--spd) sill at level three and they also know [stealth](#stealth-dex--spd--int), they can **fork** their stealth skill into their thievery test. Any number of skills can be **forked** into a test, but each **fork** only grants **+1D6**. For the thievery test above, it doesn't matter if the character is at stealth level one or five or nine-thousand. They only get a **+1D6** to their thievery test. So in this case, if the **GM** agrees, the player gets to roll **4D6** for their test. 

Which skills can be **forked** into a particular test is up to the **GM**. If a player is performing a test, they can lobby for the use of the skills they want to **fork** into their particular test, but ultimately, if the **GM** says no, that decision is final. 

> Back to the thievery example. Let's assume a **PC** is trying to quickly unlock a door, because they're being chased by guards and desperately need to get away. They could argue to use their [stealth](#stealth-dex--spd--int) skill, but ultimately, what use is stealth when you've already been detected? Unless you can make yourself *unseen* somehow, the **GM** should rule that stealth cannot apply in that situation. 

### Intent & Action
The players drive the story and the action. When deciding on what to do, make sure you state the **intent** of your action, like "I will make that person work for us!". 

Then, the **GM** will need to know how you aim to follow up on your intent. Describe the **action** you will take. The clearer, the better. "I will tell them of our exploits and how well we get paid!", is a good response and allows the **GM** to conclude you're trying to [persuade](#persuasion-emp) the other character. Even better would be something like "I will *persuade* them by telling them of our exploits and how well we get paid!" That leaves no room for doubt *how* you wish to achieve your goal. 

Of course, how appropriate a certain skill is for the resolution of a given situation, is ultimately up to the **GM** and the specifics of the situation itself. 

### Learning Skills
Whenever asked to test a skill a **PC** does not yet know, it will be added or progressed in the *currently learning* section of the character sheet. 

A skill in learning can only be tested with their related [attribute](#attributes). If multiple attributes are listed for a skill, you can choose which one to test with. 

The outcome of a test gets noted on the skill it was made for, not the attribute actually used for the test. 

### Advancing Skills
Whenever a **PC** uses a skill in a [test](#tests), the outcome must be noted. The number of successes/failures of the roll don't matter, only if the test as a whole was a success or a failure. 

TODO math

#### Practice
It is possible to advance skills *passively*. Whenever a large period of time is spent outside of active adventure, **PC**'s can practice a skill of choice. 

TODO math

#### Teaching
Much like it is possible for a character to [practice](#practice) on their own, they can also be taught by another, who knows more than them. 

TODO math

### Skill List
The following list does not and cannot aim to be a complete listing of all possible skills in game. Adding new skills as necessary will have to be done by the **GM**. 

For a human, a skill at level ten represents an absolute, almost god-like mastery of that skill. It is possible to go higher than that, but that should be extremely rare. Instead, the average skill a human could reasonably have in a skill they've been practicing for months, should be around two or three. Only years of experience allow for a four or five. Anything higher than five should be considered excellence. 

### Physical skills
These skills have a dominant physical aspect and are directly tied to a character's *physical attributes*. 

#### Acrobatics (Agi)
Performing acrobatic feats, such as jumping and climbing, without inuring oneself in the process. 

#### Instrument-Playing < instrument > (Agi)

## Ambitions, Beliefs & Instincts
While all characters are expected to have ambitions, beliefs and instincts, **PC**s are special in that these concepts are cemented through rules and mechanics. 

Ambitions, beliefs and instincts can not change during a game session. They can only be changed in-between. 

Whenever a player plays to their **ambitions**, **belifs** and **instincts** in certain ways, they are awarded [fate points](#fate-points). 

### Ambition
Every **PC** must have at least one ambition - a life-fulfilling long-term goal to pursue, which is to be determined during character creation. This can be anything from "found a family" to "become king of the world!". No matter how unrealistic, an ambition is a primary driver for a character, to drive them onward. The important part is to think *big*. Something easily achievable would make for a dull ambition and defeat the point of it. 

An ambition is not expected to change often. An ideal ambition would last a character a long time. 

### Beliefs
A player also has to decide on three beliefs for their character, which represent short-term goals and expectations of the character and their player. A belief should not be a triviality, but instead a goal that requires some considerable effort on both the character's and player's part to achieve. 

A belief must be based on the events and circumstances affecting the character in game. 

> For example, a **PC** learns of a conspiracy against their lord during the session. After the session, they decide they'll change one of their beliefs to "I will uncover the plot against my lord!"

Beliefs can also target other **PC**s. You can either set a belief to help or even change your fellow **PC**. Be mindful though, your belief should not be *too* drastic.

> For example, a **PC** learns their ally is a member of a secretive and dangerous cult. After the session, the player determines the new belief "I will get my ally to leave that dangerous cult!" Whether successful or not, this belief, in play, will create an **interesting conflict** between the two **PC**s. 

Beliefs are expected to change frequently. 

### Instincts
Much like [beliefs](#beliefs), a player must determine three instincts for their character. 

An instinct represents an automatic reaction from the character, given a situation that triggers the instinct. They can be seen as "if/then" and "always/never" statements. 

> For example: "Whenever someone praises the state religion, I start ranting against it."

Ideally, an instinct should be (ab-)usable by the **GM**, to get the **PC** into *trouble* easier. This is to be taken with a wink, though. A **GM** is expected to craft an *interesting* story and thus create *interesting* conundrums for the players and their characters, with a realistic chance for the players and their characters to maneuver themselves back out of trouble. 

Instincts are expected to change frequently. 

## Health & Exhaustion
Every character has **Hit Points (HP)** and a maximum number of **Injuries (Inj.)** they can endure, before they die. 

Whenever a character is hurt, the **damage** that has been inflicted upon them is deducted from their **HP**. When their **HP** reach zero, they suffer an **Inj.** and their **HP** is reset to their **maximum - N**, where *N* is the number of **Inj.** they currently have. So, in other words, for every **Inj.**, a character loses one maximum **HP**. 

Whenever a character suffers an **Inj.**, they must also suffer a [debility](#debility), randomly chosen from the table below. A **D100** roll determines the [debility](#debility). 

If a [debility](#debility) causes an [attribute](#attributes) to drop to zero, they fall unconscious, until the [attribute](#attributes) is raised back up to at least one. For example, by removing the [debility](#debility). 

Whenever a character is brought to at least half their maximum number of **Inj.**, they must pass a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test, or else fall unconscious. 

If a character is brought to their **injury limit**, they die. **PC**s are an exception, they instead arrive at [death's door](#deaths-door). 

For every point in [toughness](#toughness-tough), a character gains **+1 maximum HP**. 

For every two points in [toughness](#toughness-tough), a character raises their **Inj.** limit by one. 

### Injury
An **injury** is an abstraction of a serious health impediment of a character. Every **injury** brings a character closer to death and every character has a maximum number of **injuries** they can endure. 

For every day an **injury** remains untreated, it will cause an additional **injury**. A successful [medicine](#medicine-int) or [surgery](#surgery-int) test is required to treat all current **injuries** of a character. 

To fully recover from an injury, a character must spend **Nd4** weeks in recovery, where *N* is the current number of injuries. 

### Debility
A **debility** is represents a long-term ailment for a character, usually as a result of an [injury](#injury). A **debility** can reduce [attributes](#attributes) and impose other restrictions. 

**Debilities** must be removed, one by one, via successful [surgery](#surgery-int). Only one [surgery](#surgery-int) attempt can be made every 24 hours. 

If the attempt at [surgery](#surgery-int) is a partial failure, the **debility** is not removed, but another attempt can be made. 

If the attempt at [surgery](#surgery-int) is a complete failure, the **debility** becomes permanent. It cannot be removed via [surgery](#surgery-int) anymore. 

How many times a **debility** can be suffered, can be limited. In the table, the *max* is the maximum number of times the **debility** can be suffered by the same character. If there is a slash (/), there is no limit. If a roll would result in an already maxed out **debility**, pick the next **debility** below it, instead. 

| Range D100 | Debility            | Max | Description                      |
| ---------  | ------------------- | --- | -------------------------------- |
| 0 - 6      | Butchered Arm       | 2   | -1 [Agility](#agility-agi); Actions and equipment requiring two hands cannot be used. If incurred twice, any actions requiring arm movement is impossible. |
| 7 - 12     | Broken Leg          | 2   | -1 [Agility](#agility-agi); Max movement of 3'/1m; If incurred twice, movement on their own is impossible. |
| 13 - 18    | Skull Fracture      | 1   | -1 [Intelligence](#intelligence-int); -1 [Wisdom](#wisdom-wis) |
| 19 - 24    | Concussion          | /   | -1 [Intelligence](#intelligence-int); -1 [Perception](#perception-perc) |
| 25 - 30    | Punctured Lung      | /   | -1 [Endurance](#endurance-end) |
| 31 - 36    | Bacterial Infection | 1   | -1 [Toughness](#toughness-tough); Within a day, the character will contract an [illness](#illness). |
| 37 - 42    | Fractured Rib       | /   | -1 [Toughness](#toughness-tough) | 
| 43 - 48    | Nasty Wound         | /   | +1 [Bleeding](#bleeding) |
| 49 - 54    | Broken Nose         | 1   | -1 [Perception](#perception-perc); Cannot smell; |
| 55 - 60    | Maimed Ear          | /   | -1 [Perception](#perception-perc); Cannot hear; | 
| 61 - 66    | Knocked Senseless   | /   | -1 [Perception](#perception-perc) |
| 67 - 72    | Torn Tendon         | /   | -1 [Strength](#strength-str) | 
| 73 - 79    | Mental Trauma       | /   | -1 [Will](#will-will) | 
| 80 - 90    | Tremors             | /   | -1 [Arcana](#arcana-arc) | 
| 90 - 100   | Cosmic Misfortune   | 1   | [Disadvantage](#advantage--disadvantage) on all tests. | 

### Exhaustion
Exhaustion is the measure of a character's maximum physical and mental strain they can endure. 

If a character's exhaustion reaches their threshold, they fall unconscious from extreme over-exertion. 

Exhaustion is gained through performing **exhausting actions**, carrying **exhausting equipment** or suffering [injuries](#injury). 

Exhaustion gained from **exhausting actions** can be reduced by resting. A full rest of at least six uninterrupted hours will fully clear any exhaustion gained from **exhausting actions**. 

Exhaustion gained from **exhausting equipment**, can be reduced, by dropping the equipment in question and resting for a short while, at the **GM**'s discretion. A character trying to carry more than they can endure, should not immediately fall unconscious, mind you. Apply common sense - the character in question would probably try to carry the extra equipment, only find out right away it is simply too much for them. 

### Illness
TODO

### Death's Door
**Death's door** is a state only a **PC** can enter and represents their final battle with death. 

A **PC** at death's door must succeed at least one [toughness](#toughness-tough) test out of a possible three. If they never succeed, they perish, irrevocably. If the character is at death's door during [combat](#combat), they must roll their [toughness](#toughness-tough) test at the end of the round. 

A character can be helped out of **death's door**, via the use of [medical arts](#medicine-int) or [healing magic](#restoration). 

### Damage Types
All injuries inflicted, are inflicted with a certain type of damage. 

#### Slashing
Usually inflicted by any sort of cutting/slashing weapon, like a sword, or a talon. 

#### Piercing
Usually inflicted by any sort of stabbing weapon, like a spear, or an animal's stinger. 

#### Crushing
Usually inflicted by any sort of blunt weapon, like a hammer, or an animal's tusks. 

#### Burning
Inflicted by fire. 

#### Freezing
Inflicted by extreme cold. 

#### Poison
Usually represents a [damage over time effect](#damage-over-time). 

#### Acid
Dissolves anything it touches, or perhaps just organic matter. 

### Damage Resistances
Some creatures can resist certain [types of damage](#damage-types) naturally, while others may cover themselves in armor to the same effect. 

Whether all, half or a certain amount of [injuries](#injury) is resisted, depends on the specifics of the creature or character and their [equipment](#possessions--equipment). 

### Damage Over Time
Also known as *damage over time* or *status effect*, these are [damage types](#damage-types), which inflict injuries over a set period of time. 

Every **damage over time** has an **intensity level**. The intensity governs how many injuries a afflicted character/creature suffers and at which intervals. 

#### Bleeding
One injury per intensity level, per round of combat, or every minute. 

#### Poisoned
One injury per intensity level, per round of combat, or every minute. 

## Possessions & Equipment
### Money
Money is generalized as **crowns**, with no regard for regional currencies. The following table gives a brief overview of the value of crowns. 
| Cost Range | Goods                      | Services                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1-10       | Unprocessed foods; Very common things | Simple Lodgings; Sending a message a short distance with a messenger; Peasant's and hireling pay |
| 10-50      | Low to medium quality alcoholic drinks; A proper, warm meal; Simple tools and items; Simple weapons, like a dagger or woodcutter's axe; Plain clothes or cloth; Farm animals; Somewhat common things | Lodgings in a private room; Private services; Simple equipment repairs; Travel by carriage or stagecoach; A simple guard's pay |
| 50-100     | Light armor; Decorated clothes; Weapons; Shields; Fine drinks; Lordly meals; Decorative silver things; Low-quality gems; Horses; Books and Scriptures; Uncommon things | Medical services; An elite guard's pay |
| 100-500    | Medium to heavy armor; Well-made weapons; Decorative gold things; High-quality gems; Carefully bred war-steeds; Rare things |  |
| 500-1000   | Decorated armor; Decorated well-made weapons; [Magic runes](#runes); Very rare things |  |

### Carrying Capacity
How much a character can carry, is determined by their [strength](#strength-str). The limit of how much they can carry is called the **carrying capacity**. 

Worn equipment, such as clothing, armor or backpacks do not count, for as long as they're worn. Weapons still count, though. 

All things have an abstract weight associated with them. If the weight is zero, it is considered negligible and doesn't count towards the weight limit. There are also things that are simply too heavy to carry. 

> For example, an ordinary human will never be able to *carry* an entire mountain. They can carry smaller pieces (rocks), but not all at once. 

It is up to the **GM** to decide on when something is *too heavy* to carry for the character in question. 

### Weapon Types
| Weapon Type | Injuries Inflicted | Examples            |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Unarmed     | ND2 where N = [strength](#strength-str) | Sometimes, your own body is your greatest weapon. Fists and feet can cause a surprising amount of damage. |
| Short Blade | 1D2 | Shiv; Dagger; Short-sword |
| Long Blade  | 2D2 | Bastard sword; Longsword |
| Great Blade | 3D2 | Sword of war; Great sword; Zweihänder |
| Axe         | 1D3 | Hatchet; Woodcutter's axe |
| Great Axe   | 2D3 | Bearded axe; Double-sided axe |
| Spear       | 2D2 | One or two-handed spears |

#### Polearm
Two-handed polearms, like halberds or poleaxes. 

#### Club
One-handed crushing weapons, like wooden clubs. 

#### Mace
One-handed or two-handed crushing weapons, like the flanged mace or the grand-mace. 

#### Hammer
One-handed or two-handed crushing weapons with a dedicated *impact zone* on the weapon head which directs more force into the target. Examples are the one-handed warhammer or the two-handed polehammer. 

#### Short-Bow
A short distance ranged weapon, shooting arrows. 

#### Longbow
A long distance ranged weapon, shooting arrows. 

#### War-Bow
A very deadly long distance ranged weapon, shooting arrows.

## Character Creation
TODO

# Fate Points
TODO

# Combat
When diplomacy fails, hostilities ensue. 

## Who Acts When
The involved parties (= groups) act one after another. After all involed parties have had their **turn** to act, a **combat round** has passed. All members of a party act at the same time, during the party's turn. 

At the beginning of every combat encounter, the involved parties must roll for initiative. In order to determine which party gets to act first, each party rolls a **1D6**. The party rolling the higher number, goes first. If there is a tie, roll a **1D2**. If the player party is involved, a one means they get to go first. 

If one party is surprised, the ambushing party gets to act for a full turn, without initiative being rolled. This is called a *surprise round*. After the surprise round, initiative is rolled and combat begins as explained above. 

A party is considered surprised if they were unaware of their opponents when the first attack roll happens. 

> As an example: this does not count for opponents standing right in front of each other in conversation, when one of them suddenly draws a dagger and attacks. The attacker can be clearly seen by the defender and thus they must both roll for initiative, to determine whether the defender can react in time. 

## Combat Actions
Every turn, every character gets to move and use a skill, once. They can do so in any order (move first or use a skill first) or they can forego taking either or even any action. 

Speaking or shouting a short phrase is free. If you want to have a proper conversation, that will have to take multiple rounds. 

## How to Attack
All attacks made against another creature or character are made as an [opposed test](#opposed-test). 

* When attacking with a weapon: 
  * It is possible to fork other weapon skills into the attack roll. 
  * The [weapon skill](#weapon--weapon-type--str) of choice must be rolled as a [graduated test](#graduated-test). 
    * If it is a melee attack, the defender must roll a [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi) [graduated test](#graduated-test). 
    * If it is a ranged attack, the defender must roll a [ranged defence](#ranged-defence-agi) [graduated test](#graduated-test).
* When attacking with magic:
  * It is **not** possible to fork other magic skills into the attack roll. 
  * The mage must roll the specific [magic school](#magic-school--school--arc) as a [graduated test](#graduated-test).
  * The defender can either roll a [ranged defence](#ranged-defence-agi) [graduated test](#graduated-test)...
  * ...or they can roll a [magic school](#magic-school--school--arc) [graduated test](#graduated-test) of their own, to try and counter the attack. 
* Whoever has more successes, wins the [opposed test](#opposed-test). 
  * If the attacker wins, they can roll the [injuries](#injury) to inflict. That number is then reduced by [resistances and armor](#damage-resistances). The final number of injuries is then applied to the defender. 
  * If the defender wins or the result is a tie, the attack fails and no [injuries](#injury) are inflicted. 

### Types of Attack
Sometimes, simply *hitting it* isn't enough. Sometimes, more control is needed. These rules outline how a character can do more specific attacks. 

#### Aimed Attack
An attack generally targets the center of mass (torso) of the targeted opponent. 

It is, however, possible to call out wanting to attack a specific part of an opponent's body. Generally, this means that the attack must be rolled with [disadvantage](#advantage--disadvantage). However, the **GM** can also decide the part being targeted is fairly easy to hit, either generally or due to current circumstance, so no disadvantage is incurred. 

A player may call out what effect the aimed attack is supposed to have, such as limiting their opponent's ability to stand, move, attack or whatever else the body part may be useful for. If they don't, the **GM** decides the effect. 

#### Difficult Attack
There may be attacks that are more difficult to perform, due to current circumstance. Such attack rolls are [disadvantaged](#advantage--disadvantage). 

An example for a *difficult attack* would be targeting an opponent with a ranged weapon when the opponent is behind cover. 

Another example would be attacking backwards, at an invisible enemy or with a broken arm, and so on.

#### Easy Attack
Some attacks may be easier to perform. An **easy attack** is [advantaged](#advantage--disadvantage).

The following are generally considered easy attacks (but at the **GM**'s discretion):
* From behind
* Against prone opponents
* Against restrained opponents

#### Execution Attack
The extreme version of an easy attack, the **execution attack** allows outright killing or maiming an opponent, without having to roll for an attack or for damage. 

Such an attack can be carried out against any character who is unable to resist (with the exception of player characters, see [death's door](#deaths-door)). 

> An unconscious character, or one chained to the wall couldn't possibly resist and can be instantaneously killed with an **execution attack**. 

This kind of attack is only possible at the **GM**'s discretion. 

# Magic
Any character with [arcana](#arcana-arc), can cast magic. What kind of magic, depends on the [magic schools](#magic-schools) the character knows. 

## Spell Intensity
Any magic can be cast at different **intensities**. A greater **spell intensity** results in a greater effect, at a proportionally greater cost. 

Whenever a mage casts a spell, they must roll **ND3**, where *N* is the **spell intensity** they're casting the spell at. The number they roll, is the amount of [exhaustion](#exhaustion) they gain from casting the spell. The amount of [exhaustion](#exhaustion) gained is reduced by a mage's **exhaustion resistance**, which is governed by their [arcana](#arcana-arc) attribute, plus their skill the related [magic school](#magic-schools). Exhaustion gain cannot be reduced to less than one. That means, whenever a mage casts a spell, no matter how significant, they gain *at least* one [exhaustion](#exhaustion). 

## Maximum Spell Intensity
A mage can only cast spells at an intensity up to a maximum, called their **maximum spell intensity**. This number is is governed by their [arcana](#arcana-arc) attribute, plus their skill in the related [magic school](#magic-schools). 

This means, for every [school of magic](#magic-schools) the mage knows, they may have a different **maximum spell intensity**. 

## Effects of Magic
While not all spells can be used offensively, those that can, will inflict [injuries](#injury), proportional to the [spell's intensity](#spell-intensity). 

The number of [injuries](#injury) inflicted, will be noted next to the [spell's intensity](#spell-intensity) levels. 

The effects of a spell do not affect the mage casting the spell, unless they cause a [spell backfire](#spell-backfire)

## Spell Backfire
If a mage's exhaustion level reaches their threshold, by or while casting a spell, the spell **backfires**. This causes the spell to inflict its injuries and effects only upon the mage casting it. 

## Magic Schools
Noted for each spell intensity, are the effects of the spell and the maximum distance, from the caster, at which the spell can be cast or the distance up to which it can have an effect. 

If applicable, injuries inflicted, exhaustion inflicted and other such effects, will also be noted. 

### Pyromancy
The summoning and control of fire. The flame being a destructive force, pyromancers enjoy little utility from their magic, beyond the ability to create light. 

Injuries inflicted are of the [burning](#burning) damage type. 

| Spell Intensity | Injuries Inflicted | Max Distance | Effect(s) |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | --------- |
| 1  | 0   | 0      | A small, controlled flame erupts and stays in the mage's hand. Alternatively, a small flame (like a candle flame) in immediate proximity of the mage is extinguished. |
| 2  | 1D2 | 5'/1m  | A moderate torch fire erupts and stays in the mage's hand. Or a torch in immediate proximity of the mage is extinguished. |
| 3  | 2D2 | 25'/5m | A ball of fire forms in the mage's hand, ready to be flung at a nearby spot. Or a decent-sized flame is extinguished nearby. |
| 4  | 3D2 | 25'/5m | A static wall or column of flame erupts in a nearby spot of the mage's choosing. Alternatively, a nearby flame (wall) is redirected. |
| 5  | 4D2 | 40'/8m | Flame shoots out of the mage's hand in a steady stream, covering a moderate distance. Or another mage's stream of flame is redirected. |
| 6+ | N-1 D2 | 40'/8m | N = spell intensity; Causes a spot of the mage's choosing at moderate distance to explode and then burn. |

### Cryomancy
The summoning and control of ice. Besides the frostbite, cryomancer's can inflict [exhaustion](#exhaustion) on opponents, or freeze things, so they're harder to break. 

Injuries inflicted are of the [freezing](#freezing) damage type. 

| Spell Intensity | Injuries Inflicted | Exhaustion Inflicted | Max Distance | Effect(s) |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 1  | 0   | 0   | 0     | Any freezable liquid in the mage's hand immediately freezes. Doesn't work on living things. So no freezing of the blood in someone's veins, while they still live! |
| 2  | 1D2 | 1   | 5'/1m | A spot of the mage's choosing, within hand's reach, freezes over. Can be used on living things. |
| 3  | 1D2 | 1D2 | 25'/5m | An ice-shard forms from whatever liquid is in the mage's hands. It can be shot at a nearby spot of the mage's choosing. The impacted spot freezes over. |
| 4  | 2D2 | 1D3 | 40'/8m | A large ice-shard forms in the mage's hands, without requiring any liquid. It can be shot at a moderately distant spot of the mage's choosing. The impacted spot freezes over. |
| 5  | 2D2 | 2D2 | 40'/8m | A large area of the mage's choosing, at moderate distance from the mage, freezes over. |
| 6+ | N-3 D2 | 2D3 | 40'/8m | N = spell intensity; A torrent of ice and snow forms in a large area of the mage's choosing, at moderate distance. Anything within it, freezes over. |

### Restoration
The mending of injuries and treatment of diseases. 

| Spell Intensity | Injuries Removed | Max Distance | Effect(s) |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 1               | 1                | 0            | A creature of the mage's choosing, in hand's reach, is magically healed. Removes [bleeding](#bleeding). |
| 2               | 1D2              | 0            | Up to two creatures of the mage's choosing, in hand's reach, are magically healed. Removes [bleeding](#bleeding) and [poisoned](#poisoned). |
| 3+              | N-1 D2           | 0            | N = spell intensity; Up to two creatures of the mage's choosing, in hand's reach, are magically healed. Removes [bleeding](#bleeding) and [poisoned](#poisoned). |

## Magic Things

### Abyssalite
Abyssalite is a hard and brittle mineral, that has the ability to *amplify the flow of magic*. It can only be acquired from the depths of the earth and is fairly rare. 

Its surface is unnaturally smooth and covered in a fine, iridescent shine. Underneath the smooth surface, one searches for depth and color in vain. It is as though the void itself was being contained by that iridescent shell. 

Abyssalite is a hard and brittle mineral, prone to shattering if too much force is applied. This makes it difficult to shape. It is also fairly heavy, which makes it difficult to lug large amounts of it around. 

A decent-sized Abyssalite chunk has a weight of three. It grants one greater [spell intensity](#spell-intensity), but without costing any [exhaustion](#exhaustion). 

### Amberite
As magic is amplified by [Abyssalite](#abyssalite), its antithesis is called **Amberite**, a metal which dulls the effects of magic and slows any magic flow nearby it. The material is also known to affect magic creatures and can cause great pain in magic-users. 

Weapons made from Amberite are quite popular with witch and monster hunters alike, although fairly hard to come by, due to the difficulty in amber-iron processing. 

Amberite is a crystalline material, that can be molten down and shaped, like iron. It glows weakly, in the fiery orange of the name-sharing amber stone. Near the edges, the glow fades to a dull reflection, like cooling molten glass. 

It only occurs naturally in a few select places in the world, where the ground offers the right conditions. Amberite grows over time, in the right environment. It can take several decades for a finger-sized crystal to grow to the size of an adult man's forearm. Attempts to cultivate it have mostly failed, as Amberite farmers have so far been unable to understand and reproduce the right conditions for it to thrive. Due to the slow rate at which it grows, an Amberite farmer may not realize the lack of growth until well into a decade later. 

Prolonged exposure to Amberite causes severe ill-effects with nausea and migranes being common symptoms. 

### Ambersteel
Amberite can be processed into Ambersteel, which makes it a usable metal. The raw material heats slowly and must be heated over the course of several days and nights, without interruption. When it finally reaches the right temperature, it will glow white, with a purple sheen. At that point, it can be hammered into shape. Constant re-heating ensures it stays at the right temperature and a final quenching in vegetable oil ensures it retains its flexibility. 

If processed outside the optimal temperature, the material quickly grows brittle and will shatter if any stress is put on it.

Due to the length of the process and the difficulty in keeping the right temperature, smiths capable of working amber-iron are rare. 

### Runes
Shards of [Abyssalite](#abyssalite) can have runes carved into them, which allow magic to flow through the runes, as opposed to the magic-user. This renders runes extremely powerful artifacts, as they can allow for near limitless magic-use. 

To activate such a rune, is a difficult skill to learn, however. Even if no innate magical ability is required, an understanding of the flow of magic is. The rune must be touched in the right spots, at the right intervals, to activate successfully. Mistakes in this procedure can have disastrous results. 

What's more, it takes great skill to carve the right runes, as each rune's shape and complexity depends in part on the size and shape of the [Abyssalite](abyssalite) shard. The only way to get it right, is to *feel* the way the rune must be shaped. Alternatively, the shard can be adjusted to be of equivalent size and shape, but this requires considerable effort, as [Abyssalite](abyssalite) is a tough material, prone to shattering if too much force is applied, yet resistant to the common techniques of metallurgy. 

If certain runes are carved into the stones, the magic flow can even be guided in a way that allows the otherwise magically incapable of casting magic.
