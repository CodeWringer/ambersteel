Version 0.1 "Kettgard"

# Introduction
**Ambersteel** is a role-playing game, requiring a **game master** (henceforth referred to as the **GM**) and at least one **player** to play. 

On the spectrum of narrative-driven, gamey and simulationist, **Ambersteel** aims for the region between gamey and narrative-driven. Tactical and lethal combat is where most of the gamey-ness stems from, with most other aspects being kept closer towards the narrative-driven end. 

While each player only controls a single character, the **GM** is in control of every single non-player character (**NPC**), the world and the story. A player character is abbreviated as **PC**. 

The system is designed to fit a low to medium fantasy medieval setting. Player characters may be special, but they're far from heroic. Combat is deadly and magic is powerful, yet risky. The rules are designed to be as intuitive and simple as possible, while complex enough to allow players to make meaningful choices. 

Most rules will have a certain degree of vagueness to them. This is at least partially deliberate. The situations that can come up during play are simply too varied and numerous to be possible to completely cover with rules, without requiring epic tomes filled to the brim with highly specific rulings for highly specific situations. Instead, the game relies on the **GM** to arbitrate in every situation. The descriptions in the rules here should serve as a point for orientation for the **GM**. How they interpret the rules, is how they're to be understood. 

But this is not an *adversarial* game. The **GM** and the players work ***together*** to tell a compelling, interesting, humorous, tense, etc. story. Ultimately, the **GM**'s job is to provide interesting conundrums to the players and their job is to provide interesting answers, in-line with what their characters believe. What's important to remember is that the **GM** is a *player*, too. They're here to have fun and enjoy their time at the table, too. 

Another important aspect of **Ambersteel** is that character's abilities grow over time. There are neither character classes, nor character levels. Skills and attributes improve as they're being used in tests. Characters have long-term and short-term goals and beliefs, which drive them onward and which change over time. 

## How to Play
As **Ambersteel** is a **roleplaying game**, there are certain rules and expectations of both players and **GM**. 

In some places, where distances are concerned, both feet and meters are noted as units. What attentive readers will notice, is that the conversion between the numbers won't always be correct. This is a deliberate decision to make the math easier, whenever a grid (or *battlemap*) is used in play. One square on the grid should represent either a three foot, or one meter square. Furthermore, a single, ordinary human, should occupy an entire such square. 

### Dice
**Ambersteel** uses a **dice pool** system of **six-sided dice** (henceforth referred to as **D6**) to resolve [tests](#tests). *Dice pool* means a variable number of dice will be rolled, based on a character's [attributes](#attributes), [skills](#skills), boons and circumstance of the situation they're in. 

The following types of dice come into play:
* **D2** - two-sided dice; or a coin
* **D3** - three-sided dice
* **D4** - four-sided dice
* **D6** - six-sided dice
* **D10** (**D100**) - two ten-sided dice

### Before the Game
Before anyone can start to play, the players have to [create their characters](#character-creation). Ideally, this process should be done in cooperation with the **GM** and each other, to make sure the character concepts fit into the world and planned narrative. Also, it is advisable to design characters that will work well together, as a group. 

### The Session
This is the time, when the magic happens. The players and **GM** have come together and begin or continue the story. 

[Fate points](#fate-points) cannot be awarded during play and neither can cards be bought from the [hand of fate](#hand-of-fate). However, players and the **GM** should take note of every situation they believe a **PC** (their own included) could have earned a [fate point](#fate-points).

### After the Session
After a playing session is done, the players and **GM** should stick around to discuss which players earned [fate points](#fate-points). This is where players are nominated for [fate points](#fate-points), by each other and by the **GM**. If everyone agrees, the [fate points](#fate-points) are awarded. Players can and should lobby for their [fate points](#fate-points), but shouldn't beg. If most everyone else says no, then that decision stands. That doesn't mean there is no point in discussing the matter further, but such a discussion shoulnd't be forced. 

Also after the session, players and the **GM** discuss whether a **PC** should lose an [instinct](#instincts), because they have acted against it or haven't gotten to play it out at all. 

Any time in between sessions, players can spend [fate points](#fate-points) to buy cards (boons) from the [hand of fate](#hand-of-fate). 

## Tests
Whenever the outcome of an action or situation is uncertain, a **test** may be called for by the **GM**, in order to resolve it. 

As a basis for a test, either an [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills) is used. 

Either a **six** or a **five** rolled on a single die counts as a **positive**. Other values are considered **negatives**. **Positives** are required in order to succeed a test. 

The **positives** needed to succeed a test, is determined by the **GM**, via a mechanism called **obstacle** (henceforth referred to as **Ob**). The test can only succeed, if at least as many **positives** are rolled, as the *obstacle level* named by the **GM**. 

> For example, to succeed a test at **Ob 3**, at least three **positives** must be rolled. Any less, and the test outcome is a failure. 

To resolve an **attribute test**, the number of **D6** indicated by the *attribute level* (the number next to the attribute) must be rolled. 

To resolve a **skill test**, the number of **D6** indicated by the **skill level** (the number next to the skill), plus the number of **D6** indicated by the related [attribute](#attributes) must be rolled. 

For every test, one of three outcomes is possible: 
* Complete Success: There are enough or even more than required **positives**.
* Partial Success/Failure: There are not enough **positives**, but more than none. 
* Complete Failure: There are no **positives**, only **negatives**. 

### Types of Test
There are the following types of tests. The **GM** decides when each type of test is appropriate. 

#### Binary Test
The outcome of the test is an absolute success, or failure. These are tests, where the **degree of success** is irrelevant. 

#### Stepped Test
A stepped test is really just a series of [binary tests](#binary-test). This allows for finer-grained results, while not behaving like a [graduated test](#graduated-test). 

This type of test is useful for situations where the **GM** decides to create very fine *time slices* and allow more chances for success. This makes it easier to allow a **PC** to *fail forward* or prevent a *one roll to end it all* situation. 

> For example, a **PC** is attempting to cross a suspension bridge, but upon setting foot on the bridge, the ropes holding it up, suddenly snap. The **PC** can make an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test, to try and quickly jump off and back onto solid ground. They fail, and get to make another [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test, to try and grab a root sticking out of the ground beneath the bridge. As a last chance for that **PC** to survive, the **GM** asks one of the other players if their character will attempt an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test to try and grab their falling ally's hand in a daring rescue. Finally, their ally succeeds and the **PC**'s life is saved. Obviously, such a situation should not arise often, as stepped tests can quickly grow exasperating for the players. 

#### Graduated Test
The outcome of the test is graduated. That means, the number of successes rolled during the test factor into the outcome. This is called the **degree of success**. 

> For example, when crafting a work of art, the number of successes achieved may result in a more impressive piece, which can then be sold at a higher price or which could make for a more impressive gift. 

On the other hand, failure doesn't have to be absolute. The degree of failure can allow for a "failing forward" - a success, but with complications, whose severity depends on the number of failures. 

#### Creative Test
Also known as a **skill challenge**, this type of test asks the player(s) to pick and justify the skill(s) and attribute(s) to use in a given situation. Players are encouraged to think creatively and come up with solutions. 

Whether the attribute(s) and skill(s) in question apply to resolve the situation at hand, lies at the **GM**'s discretion. 

#### Opposed Test
Also known as a *versus test*, this type of test occurs, when two characters come into opposition. Who wins, and by how much, is determined by comparing the number of successes of each character. The one with the most successes is the winner. 

If there is a tie, the defending character is considered the winner. 

> For example, a character tries to sneak past another, the sneak will have to do a [stealth](#stealth-agi) test, while the other character will have to do an [observation](#observation-perc) test. If the result is a tie, the one doing the observation test is considered the defender, and wins. 

If a tie occurs in which a defender cannot be clearly determined, the result is a deadlock and neither side gains anything. 

### Advantage & Disadvantage
Certain situations may warrant a character getting advantage or disadvantage to a test they have to make. 

Advantage grants **+1D6**, while disadvantage forces **-1D6** to the test in question. 

A player may argue for their advantage in a situation, but only once, with a clear statement. Dancing around, trying and hoping to somehow convince the **GM** with vague descriptions immediately disqualifies your character from getting advantage. Arguing with the **GM** *also* immediately disqualifies your character from getting advantage. 

### Providing Assistance
Characters can help each other in tests. In order to help with a test, a character must know a relevant [skill](#skills) and the one being helped must accept the help. 

Helping in a test works much like [forking](#skill-forking) a skill. The character being helped receives **+1D6** to roll for each *character* helping them. The number of relevant skills a helping character has is irrelevant. Just one is enough to allow them to help and only one **+1D6** is granted by the helping character. Which skill is used to help with, matters, however. 

If a **PC** is helping another, their player must describe *how* they're using their relevant skill to help. 

> For example, a **PC** is currently using their [thievery](#thievery-agi) to lockpick a door. Their allied **PC** is *helping*, by using their [observation](#observation-perc) skill to *keep an eye out for guards*, which allows the one on the door to work without having to constantly look over their shoulder. The **GM** finds that description agreeable and allows the use of the skill to help. 

Ultimately, whether a skill is appropriate to help with is determined by the **GM**. 

#### Helpers Learn
A character helping in a test, also gains [progress](#advancing-skills) towards the [skill](#skills) they've helped with. If the character who was helped succeeded their test, the helper also gains a successful test to mark on their skill. 

### Time
Not all tests are created equal - some actions require more time than others. 

While the **GM** decides on how much time a given test will need, the following guidelines should provide a good basis. 

* (Near) instantaneous: Combat actions, recalling knowledge, noticing things in passing. 
* A matter of minutes: inspecting an environment, quickly skimming the contents of a book, persuading someone in conversation, first aid. 
* A matter of hours: Simple crafts, surgery, scrutinizing an environment, researching something simple/not obscure, engaging in lengthy and difficult negotiations.
* A matter of days and months: Complex crafts and artistry, researching a complex or obscure subject. 

### Fewer Tests Are Better
This section is primarily directed at the **GM**. The short of it goes as follows: 

Only have a player make one test per scene/situation, as long as the scene/situation doesn't change significantly. 

> For example, a **PC** is trying to sneak past two guards huddled around a campfire. If they succeed their [stealth](#stealth-agi) test, the **GM** lets them sneak all around the camp, without making them do multiple tests, as long as the situation doesn't change significantly. One of the guards getting up to take a pee behind a tree somewhere shouldn't be such a change, even if that happens to be the tree the **PC** is hiding behind. On the other hand, if the guards pick up torches and start actively looking for intruders, for whatever reason, then the situation changes significantly. Another [stealth](#stealth-agi) test would be warranted. 

Of course, how many tests are appropriate in a given situation is entirely the **GM**'s decision to make. 

# Character
A character is a representation of a sentient creature in the game world. They're an amalgam of [attributes](#attributes), [skills](#skills), [ambitions, beliefs & instincts](#ambitions-beliefs--instincts) and of course their [possessions](#possessions--equipment). 

## Attributes
Attributes describe a character's basic, inherent abilities. 

The value of an attribute indicates the number of **D6** to roll for a test of that attribute. Attribute values typically range from two to five for human characters. 

### Physical Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic physical abilities. 

#### Agility [Agi]
Determines how nimble, fast and flexible a character is. Any action that requires a character to move very precisely, will require agility. 

#### Endurance [End]
Governs how long a character can endure physical strains. 

For every point in endurance, a character raises their [Exhaustion Threshold](#exhaustion) by two. 

#### Perception [Perc]
Governs a character's ability to passively quickly pick up on fine and fleeting details in their environment or on objects and other characters. 

Also governs the ability to perceive under difficult conditions such as dim light and fog, or noisy and smelly environments. 

#### Strength [Str]
Governs a character's strength - the ability to lift, throw and break heavy and sturdy things. Such as skulls. Also governs the [carrying capacity](#carrying-capacity) of a character. 

Each point in strength raises the [carrying capacity](#carrying-capacity) of the character by three. 

#### Toughness [Tough]
Governs the [injury threshold](#injury) of a character. 

For every point in [toughness](#toughness-tough), a character gains **+2 maximum HP**. 

For every two points in [toughness](#toughness-tough), a character raises their **Inj.** limit by 1. 

### Mental Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic mental abilities. 

#### Arcana [Arc]
Governs a character's ability to control magic flow, sense magic and withstand magic-exertion effects. 

Also used to resist negative magic effects. 

For every point in arcana, a character raises their [maximum spell intensity](#maximum-spell-intensity) by one and their [exhaustion resistance](#magic) by one. 

#### Intelligence [Int]
Governs a character's ability to reason and analyze. 

Also affects a character's speed of learning. 

#### Wisdom [Wis]
Governs a character's understanding of and ability to recall knowledge. 

### Social Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic social abilities. 

#### Empathy [Emp]
Governs a character's ability to read and understand another's emotions and intentions. 

#### Oratory [Ora]
Governs a character's ability to convincingly speak with and before others. Also used to manipulate others. 

#### Will [Will]
Governs a character's ability to withstand persuasion, intimidation, charm or terror. 

### Advancing Attributes
Whenever a **PC** uses an attribute in a [test](#tests), the outcome must be noted. 

Advancing an attribute requires:
* N * N / 2 (rounded up) **complete successess**.
* N * N **partial successess** or **complete failures**.
* Where *N* is the current level of the attribute. 

> A character has a [strength](#strength-str) attribute at level 1. 
> 
> To advance their attribute to level 2, they would need 2 * 2 / 2 = 2 **complete successes** and 2 * 2 = 4 **partial successess** or **complete failures**

> A character has a [will](#will-will) attribute at level 3. 
> 
> To advance their attribute to level 4, they would need 3 * 3 / 2 = 5 **complete successes** and 3 * 3 = 9 **partial successess** or **complete failures**

## Skills
A skill is any acquired knowledge and experience regarding a specific subject. 

All of a character's skills have a value attached to them, which indicates the number of **D6** to use when testing that skill. 

Skills can be improved over time. Every time a roll for a skill is made, the outcome will be noted. Whenever a certain threshold of successes and failures is passed, the skill improves. Both a certain number of successes *and* a certain number of failures must be accumulated to grow a skill. 

### Skill Forking
For every skill a character knows (= is not currently still learning), and they are currently testing a skill that is thematically related, they can **fork** that skill into their test, granting them **+1D6** for their test. 

> Imagine a large forked rivermouth. One of the forks feeding into it is also a large river, which represents the skill primarily being tested. The other, smaller forks of the river represent the supporting skills. They all combine together at the rivermouth. A primary and supporting skills flow together into the test! 

> For example, if a character is testing their [thievery](#thievery-dex--perc--spd) sill at level three and they also know [stealth](#stealth-dex--spd--int), they can **fork** their stealth skill into their thievery test. Any number of skills can be **forked** into a test, but each **fork** only grants **+1D6**. For the thievery test above, it doesn't matter if the character is at stealth level one or five or nine-thousand. They only get a **+1D6** to their thievery test. So in this case, if the **GM** agrees, the player gets to roll **4D6** for their test. 

Which skills can be **forked** into a particular test is up to the **GM**. If a player is performing a test, they can lobby for the use of the skills they want to **fork** into their particular test, but ultimately, if the **GM** says no, that decision is final. 

> Back to the thievery example. Let's assume a **PC** is trying to quickly unlock a door, because they're being chased by guards and desperately need to get away. They could argue to use their [stealth](#stealth-dex--spd--int) skill, but ultimately, what use is stealth when you've already been detected? Unless you can make yourself *unseen* somehow, the **GM** should rule that stealth cannot apply in that situation. 

### Intent & Action
The players drive the story and the action. When deciding on what to do, make sure you state the **intent** of your action, like "I will make that person work for us!". 

Then, the **GM** will need to know how you aim to follow up on your intent. Describe the **action** you will take. The clearer, the better. "I will tell them of our exploits and how well we get paid!", is a good response and allows the **GM** to conclude you're trying to [persuade](#persuasion-emp) the other character. Even better would be something like "I will *persuade* them by telling them of our exploits and how well we get paid!" That leaves no room for doubt *how* you wish to achieve your goal. 

Of course, how appropriate a certain skill is for the resolution of a given situation, is ultimately up to the **GM** and the specifics of the situation itself. 

### Learning Skills
Whenever asked to test a skill a **PC** does not yet know, it will be added or progressed in the *currently learning* section of the character sheet. 

A skill in learning can only be tested with their related [attribute](#attributes). If multiple attributes are listed for a skill, you can choose which one to test with. 

The outcome of a test gets noted on the skill it was made for, not the attribute actually used for the test. 

### Advancing Skills
Whenever a **PC** uses a skill in a [test](#tests), the outcome must be noted. 

Advancing a skill requires:
* 2 + N * 2 **complete successess**.
* 4 + N * 3 **partial successess** or **complete failures**.
* Where *N* is the current level of the skill. 

> A character has a [nature](#nature-int) skill at level 1. 
> 
> To advance their skill to level 2, they would need 2 + 1 * 2 = 4 **complete successes** and 4 + 1 * 3 = 7 **partial successess** or **complete failures**

> A character has a [medicine](#medicine-int) skill at level 4. 
> 
> To advance their skill to level 5, they would need 2 + 4 * 2 = 10 **complete successes** and 4 + 4 * 3 = 16 **partial successess** or **complete failures**

#### Practice
It is possible to advance skills *passively*. Whenever a large period of time is spent outside of active adventure, **PC**'s can practice a skill of choice. 

A **PC** can only actively practice one **category of skills**. For every **cycle** that passes of active practice, the **PC** can roll a [test](#tests) of a skill of the corresponding category. 

| Skill Category | Cycle    |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Physical       | 3 Weeks  |
| Social         | 2 Week   |
| Knowledge      | 3 Months |
| Craftsmanship  | 2 Months |

> A **PC** spends seven weeks practicing their [fighting](#fighting-str), while waiting for their comrade to recover from their [injuries](#injury). Being a physical skill, **fighting** the cycle for tests is 3 weeks. In this case, 2 tests can be made and their outcomes noted. 

#### Teaching
Much like it is possible for a character to [practice](#practice) on their own, they can also be taught by another, who knows more than them. 

Both teacher and pupil must actively spend time together, furthering the pupil's skill. The rules for cycle and test are the same as with [practice](#practice). The cycles noted in the table below are used instead. 

| Skill Category | Cycle    |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Physical       | 2 Weeks  |
| Social         | 1 Week   |
| Knowledge      | 2 Months |
| Craftsmanship  | 1 Months |

## Skill List
The following list does not and cannot aim to be a complete listing of all possible skills in game. Adding new skills as necessary will have to be done by the **GM**. 

For a human, a skill at level ten represents an absolute, almost god-like mastery of that skill. It is possible to go higher than that, but that should be extremely rare. Instead, the average skill a human could reasonably have in a skill they've been practicing for months, should be around two or three. Only years of experience allow for a four or five. Anything higher than five should be considered excellence.

## Ambitions, Beliefs & Instincts
While all characters are expected to have *ambitions*, *beliefs* and *instincts*, **PC**s are special, because for them, these concepts are cemented through rules and mechanics. 

**Ambitions**, **beliefs** and **instincts** can not change during a game session. They can only be changed in-between. 

Whenever a player plays to their **ambitions**, **beliefs** and **instincts** in certain ways, they earn [fate points](#fate-points). 

It is the **GM**'s role, to create interesting situations, which can *challenge* the **beliefs** and **instincts**, or even **ambitions** of the **PC**s. However the players and **PC**s react, can earn them [fate points](#fate-points) and will drive the story forward. 

### Ambition
Every **PC** must have one **ambition** - a life-fulfilling long-term goal to pursue. This can be anything from "found a family" to "become king of the world!". No matter how unrealistic, an **ambition** is a primary driver for a character, to guide them onward. The important part is to think *big*. Something easily achievable would make for a dull **ambition** and defeat the point of it. 

An **ambition** is not expected to change often. An ideal **ambition** would accompany a character a long time. 

### Beliefs
A player also has to decide on three **beliefs** for their character, which represent short-term goals and expectations of the character and their player. A belief should not be a triviality, but instead a goal that requires some considerable effort on both the character's and player's part to achieve. 

A belief must be based on the events and circumstances affecting the character in game. 

> For example, a **PC** learns of a conspiracy against their lord during the session. After the session, they decide they'll change one of their **beliefs** to "I will uncover the plot against my lord!"

**Beliefs** can also target other **PC**s. You can either set a belief to help or even change your fellow **PC**. Be mindful though, your belief should not be *too* drastic.

> For example, a **PC** learns their ally is a member of a secretive and dangerous cult. After the session, the player determines the new belief "I will get my ally to leave that dangerous cult!" Whether successful or not, this belief, in play, will create an **interesting conflict** between the two **PC**s. 

**Beliefs** are expected to change frequently, commonly from session to session. But not so frequent as to make achieving them impossible. 

### Instincts
Much like [beliefs](#beliefs), a player must determine three **instincts** for their character. 

An **instinct** represents an automatic reaction from the character, given a situation that triggers it. They can be seen as "if/then" and "always/never" statements. These can either be beneficial or detrimental to the character. 
* A detrimental **instinct** acts as a *troublemaker* and allows earning [fate points](#fate-points). 
* A beneficial **instinct** acts as *insurance*, but doesn't allow earning [fate points](#fate-points). 

> For example: "Whenever someone praises the state religion, I start ranting against it." - This is a detrimental **instinct**, as the **GM** can use that to cause the **PC** trouble. 

> Another example: "Whenever a lethal fight breaks out, I have my weapons in hand!" - This is insurance, that even when the **PC** narratively might not have their weapons at the ready, they will, in fact, have them at the ready. 

Ideally, an **instinct** should be (ab-)usable by the **GM**, to get the **PC** into *trouble* easier. This is to be taken with a wink, though. A **GM** is expected to craft an *interesting* story and thus create *interesting* conundrums for the players and their characters, with a realistic chance for the players and their characters to maneuver themselves back out of trouble. 

**Instincts** are expected to change whenever a character (decides) to act against them. A **PC** cannot keep an instinct they keep contradicting. 

## Health & Exhaustion
Every character has **Hit Points (HP)** and a maximum number of **Injuries (Inj.)** they can endure, before they die. 

Whenever a character is hurt, the **damage** that has been inflicted upon them is deducted from their **HP**. When their **HP** reach zero, they suffer an **Inj.** and their **HP** is reset to their **maximum - N\*2**, where *N* is the number of **Inj.** they currently have. So, in other words, for every **Inj.**, a character loses 2 maximum **HP**. Any **HP** past zero overflow, so the damage dealt isn't lost. 

When [Toughness](#toughness-tough) is reduced, still only 2 maximum **HP** are deducted. 

Outside of combat, a successful [medicine](#medicine-int) test can restore all currently missing **HP** of a character. 

### Injury
An **injury (Inj.)** is a serious health impediment of a character. Every character has a maximum number of **Inj.** they can endure. If they reach their maximum number of **Inj.**, the character dies. **PC**s are an exception, who instead arrive at [death's door](#deaths-door). 

Whenever a character suffers an **Inj.**, a **D100** must be rolled and the corresponding result from the [list of injuries](#list-of-injuries) added to the character. 

Whenever a character is brought to at least half their maximum number of **Inj.** (rounded down), they must succeed a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test, or else suffer +1 [exhaustion](#exhaustion). 

An **Inj.** can reduce [attributes](#attributes) and impose other restrictions. An [attribute](#attributes) cannot be brought down to less than 1, by **Inj.**

There are three possible states of an **Inj.**: **active**, **patched up** or **treated**

Only an **active** **Inj.** imposes negative effects. 

An **Inj.** can be **patched up** via [medicine](#medicine-int):
* If the attempt is a complete success, the **Inj.** is **patched up**.
* If the attempt is a partial success or a complete failure, the **Inj.** remains **active**. 

An **Inj.** can be properly **treated** via [surgery](#surgery-int): 
* If the attempt is a complete success, the **Inj.** is **treated**. 
* If the attempt is a partial success, the **Inj.** is not **treated**, but another attempt can be made. 
* If the attempt at is a complete failure, the **Inj.** becomes permanent. It cannot be **treated** via [surgery](#surgery-int) anymore. 
* Only one [surgery](#surgery-int) attempt can be made every 24 hours. 

All currently **treated** **Inj.** can be removed/recovered from, by spending **ND4** weeks in recovery, where *N* is the current number of **treated** **Inj.** 

#### List of Injuries
How many times a **debility** can be suffered, can be limited. In the table below, the *max* is the maximum number of times the **debility** can be suffered by the same character. If there is a slash (/), there is no limit. If a roll would result in an already maxed out **debility**, pick the next **debility** below it, instead. 

| Range D100 | Injury              | Max | Description                      |
| ---------  | ------------------- | --- | -------------------------------- |
| 0 - 5      | Cosmic Fortune      | /   | Luck is with you! You suffer no **debility**! |
| 6 - 10     | Butchered Arm       | 2   | -1 [Agility](#agility-agi); Actions and equipment requiring two hands cannot be used. If incurred twice, any actions requiring arm movement is impossible. |
| 11 - 15    | Broken Leg          | 2   | -1 [Agility](#agility-agi); Max movement of 3'/1m; If incurred twice, actions involving movement are impossible. |
| 16 - 19    | Skull Fracture      | 1   | -1 [Intelligence](#intelligence-int); -1 [Wisdom](#wisdom-wis) |
| 20 - 24    | Concussion          | /   | -1 [Intelligence](#intelligence-int); -1 [Perception](#perception-perc) |
| 25 - 30    | Punctured Lung      | /   | -1 [Endurance](#endurance-end) |
| 31 - 36    | Infection           | 1   | -1 [Toughness](#toughness-tough); Within a day, the character will contract an [illness](#illness). This will happen, even if the **Inj.** is treated. |
| 37 - 42    | Fractured Rib       | /   | -1 [Toughness](#toughness-tough) | 
| 43 - 48    | Nasty Wound         | /   | +1 [Bleeding](#bleeding) |
| 49 - 54    | Broken Nose         | 1   | -1 [Perception](#perception-perc); Cannot smell; |
| 55 - 60    | Maimed Ear          | /   | -1 [Perception](#perception-perc); Cannot hear; | 
| 61 - 66    | Knocked Senseless   | /   | -1 [Perception](#perception-perc) |
| 67 - 72    | Torn Tendon         | /   | -1 [Strength](#strength-str) | 
| 73 - 79    | Mental Trauma       | /   | -1 [Will](#will-will) | 
| 80 - 94    | Tremors             | /   | -1 [Arcana](#arcana-arc); [Agility](#agility-agi) | 
| 95 - 100   | Cosmic Misfortune   | 1   | [Disadvantage](#advantage--disadvantage) on all tests. | 

### Exhaustion
Exhaustion is the measure of a character's maximum physical and mental strain they can endure. 

If a character's exhaustion reaches their threshold, they become [dazed](#dazed) from over-exertion. 

Exhaustion is gained through performing **exhausting actions**, carrying **exhausting equipment** or suffering [injuries](#injury). **Exhausting actions** are any actions that are physically or mentally taxing, such as:
* Attacking
* Acrobatics (jumping, climbing)
* [Casting Magic](#casting-magic)

Exhaustion gained from **exhausting actions** can be reduced by resting. A full rest of at least six uninterrupted hours will fully clear any exhaustion gained from **exhausting actions**. 

Exhaustion gained from **exhausting equipment**, can be reduced, by dropping the equipment in question and resting for a short while, at the **GM**'s discretion. A character trying to carry more than they can endure, should not immediately fall unconscious, mind you. Apply common sense - the character in question would probably try to carry the extra equipment, only find out right away it is simply too much for them. 

### Status Effects
Characters can have one or more **status effect(s)** affecting them. A **status effect** can have positive or negative effects on the character. 

#### Dazed
A **dazed** character begins their turn with -2 **AP**. 

#### Death's Door
**Death's door** is a state only a **PC** can enter and represents their final battle with death. 

A **PC** at **death's door** must succeed at least one [toughness](#toughness-tough) test out of a possible of three. If they never succeed, they perish, irrevocably. 
* If the character is at **death's door** during [combat](#combat), they must make a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test at the end of every round. 
* If the character is at **death's door** out of [combat](#combat), they must make a test every minute. 

A character can be helped out of **death's door**, if all of their **active** **Inj.** are **patched up** or **treated**. For every **active** **Inj.** that is **patched up** or **treated**, the character gains one more attempt to succeed a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test. 

### Illness
An illness can affect a character over a perod of time and cause various negative effects. 

Illness can be contracted in a variety of ways, although most of them involve an open wound exposed to bacterial breeding grounds, such as bogs, sewers, mass graves and trash dumps. Or from something ingested, such as spoiled or poisoned food. 

When a character is about to contract an illness, they most make a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test:
* On a **complete success**, the illness is shrugged off. 
* On a **partial success** or **complete failure**, the illness is contracted and will immediately apply its effects to the character. 
* If they contracted the illness, determine which one by rolling a **D100** and picking the corresponding illness from the [list of illnesses](#list-of-illnesses). 
  * Once the illness has been determined, its duration and severity must also be rolled. 

Most illnesses have a duration, during which their effects are active and after which, all ill-effects go away. In some cases, an illness may have a duration of "until cured", which means it will never go away, if not treated. 

Treatment of an illness is possible through [medicine](#medicine-int) or [surgery](#surgery-int). Which skill is required, will be noted on the illness. Treatment will often be able to reduce the ill-effects and sometimes to remove the illness, altogether. A treatment attempt can only be made once every 24 hours. 

Any illness, that when treated has its duration reduced, can only have its duration reduced once. If a treatment would also suspend any ill-effects, that would still be applicable. That way, treating an illness which already had its duration reduced can still be useful. 

#### List of Illnesses

| Range D100 | Name         | Duration      | Effect      | Treatment |
| ---------- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------- | --------- |

### Damage Types
All damage inflicted, is inflicted with a certain type of damage. 

| Damage Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Slashing    | Usually inflicted by any sort of cutting/slashing weapon, like a sword, or a talon. |
| Piercing    | Usually inflicted by any sort of stabbing weapon, like a spear, or an animal's stinger. |
| Bludgeoning | Inflicted by light blunt weapons and unarmed attacks. **Bludgeoning** causes non-lethal damage. It inflicts [exhaustion](#exhaustion) instead of [injuries](#injury). |
| Crushing    | Usually inflicted by any sort of heavy blunt weapon, like a hammer, or an animal's tusks. |
| Burning     | Inflicted by extreme heat. |
| Freezing    | Inflicted by extreme cold. |
| Poison      | Usually represents a [damage over time effect](#damage-over-time).. |
| Acid        | Dissolves anything it touches, or perhaps just organic matter. |

### Damage Over Time
Also known as *damage over time* or *status effect*, these are [damage types](#damage-types), which inflict injuries over a set period of time. 

Every **damage over time** has an **intensity level**. The intensity governs how many injuries a afflicted character/creature suffers and at which intervals. 

| Damage Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Bleeding    | One point of **damage** per intensity level, per round of **combat**, or every minute. |
| Poisoned    | One point of **damage** per intensity level, per round of **combat**, or every minute. |

### Damage Resistances
Some creatures can resist certain [types of damage](#damage-types) naturally, while others may cover themselves in armor to the same effect. 

How much **damage** is resisted, depends on the specifics of the creature or character and their [equipment](#possessions--equipment). 

## Possessions & Equipment
A character may have things on their persion, such as worn equipment, as well as the things they *own*. 

### Money
Money is generalized as **crowns**, with no regard for regional currencies. The following table gives a brief overview of the value of crowns. 
| Cost Range | Goods                      | Services                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |

### Carrying Capacity
How much a character can carry, is determined by their [strength](#strength-str). The limit of how much they can carry is called the **carrying capacity**. 

Worn equipment, such as clothing, armor or backpacks do not count, for as long as they're worn. Weapons still count, though. 

All things have an abstract weight associated with them. If the weight is zero, it is considered negligible and doesn't count towards the weight limit. There are also things that are simply too heavy to carry. 

> For example, an ordinary human will never be able to *carry* an entire mountain. They can carry smaller pieces (rocks), but not all at once. 

It is up to the **GM** to decide on when something is *too heavy* to carry for the character in question. 

### Weapon Types
Weapons can have one or more of the following **weapon attributes**:
* **Long Reach**: Allows attacking a target two squares (6'/2m) away. 
* **Range Only**: Implies a weapon cannot be used against any targets adjacent to self. 
* **Prefer Range**: +2 **Ob** to using the weapon against an adjacent target. 

Weapons can have one or more of the following **effects**:
* A **counter-attack** is a reaction that allows a fighter being attacked to attack their attacker. 

#### Unarmed

# Fate Points
Fate points (**FP**) represent a meta-currency that *players* can earn and use to buy boons for their character or the group as a whole. 

There are three types of **FP**: [Minor](#minor-fate-points), [major](#major-fate-points) and [ambition](#ambition-fate-points). 

**FP** are earned, by playing to one's [ambitions, beliefs and instincts](#ambitions-beliefs--instincts). Most **FP** are earned by a single player, but some may also be earned as a group. 

## Minor Fate Points
**Minor Fate Points (MiFP)** are the lowest valued and most common type of **FP**, most commonly earned by playing the mechanics of the game. 

**MiFP** can be earned in the following ways: 
* **Beliefs**: Playing to one's **beliefs**. This only counts *working towards* a goal set by a belief. 
* **Trouble**: Playing to one's **instincts** - if they get their character, or their allies, into trouble. 
* **Humor**: Stopping the table with a good bit of humor at the right time. But don't overdo it - your **GM** can only weave you a dramatic and gripping story, if you let them. 
* **Specialist**: Driving the story forward, when no one else could - having the right skill to employ at the right time. 
* **Helper**: Helping an ally out at a critical time - during or out of [combat](#combat). 

## Major Fate Points
**Major Fate Points (MaFP)** take more effort from the *player* to earn, only being earned through convincing roleplaying, creative efforts and accomplishing long-term goals. 

**MaFP** can be earned in the following ways: 
* **Beliefs**: Accomplishing a goal set by a belief. 
* **Achievements**: Whenever a major plot point or story arc is concluded - a great journey, uncovering a plot of assassination, fulfilling a contract to clear out a bandit camp or discovering an ancient artifact, all count as *achievements*, which earn this award **for all the players, as a group**. 
* **Embodiment**: Capturing their character and personifying them, in the moment. For example, by giving a great speech, acting scared or enjoying a bitter revenge with glee, as if they were actually there and doing it. 
* **Inner Turmoil**: Convincingly acting out an inner conflict that may come up when a decision that conflicts with a **belief** comes up. If the others can *feel* the gut-wrenching decision being made, this award is earned!
* **Creative Solutions**: Coming up with a very creative way to solve a problem. This may be a diplomatic solution, where the **GM** thought one impossible. Or, perhaps an unexpected use of the environment during **combat**, which earned the **PC**s a distinct advantage on the battlefield, in a way the **GM** couldn't foresee. 
* **Collaboration**: Working with the **GM** to further the world and the story in creative ways and helping the **GM** out when possible. Secret plots that only one of the players is involved in, which causes gasps and applause from the other players, when the plot is finally revealed, for example. 
* **The Gears**: Being *the gears*, without which nothing would move. Doing the laborious work during session, nobody wants to do, but which has to happen to keep the story moving. Always making sure to pitch the tents in the right spot, watching out for traps or doing the boring question-asking all earn this award!

## Ambition Fate Points
**Ambition Fate Points (AFP)** are very rare and only earned through outstanding achievements. 

**AFP** can be earned in the following ways: 
* **World-Shaper**: Changing the world around oneself in a significant way. 
* **Selfless**: Going above and beyond to achieve something, a betterment, not for oneself, but for others and at great cost. 

## Hand of Fate
The **Hand of Fate** is a deck of cards a player can draw from, using their **FP** as currency to buy cards. 

A player can play any of their cards whenever appropriate. A played card is discarded. 

There are no limits to how many of a given card a player can own, but they may only hoard a maximum of 5 cards at a time. 

| Cost    | Name               | Effect             |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 3 MiFP  | Single Re-Roll     | Re-Roll a single **negative** die. |
| 5 MiFP  | Test Advantage     | Gain [advantage](#advantage--disadvantage) on your next/current test. |
| 10 MiFP | Clotter            | One **active Inj.** of choice is now **patched up**. |
| 1 MaFP  | Fact Check         | Change a minor plot point in a way your prefer. Work with your **GM** to make sure it fits the narrative, but they should respect your wish. This could be something like avoiding an **NPC** death or changing a fact about the plot. |
| 1 MaFP  | Just a Flesh Wound | Remove or avoid one non-permanent **Inj.** of choice. |
| 1 MaFP  | Hastened           | Gain +1 **AP** during your turn when in [combat](#combat). |
| 5 MaFP  | Double the Fun     | Double the number of dice to roll on your next/current test. |
| 10 MaFP | Wrong Diagnosis    | Remove or avoid one permanent **Inj.** of choice. |
| 1 AFP   | Defy Death         | Leap from [death's door](#deaths-door), remove 1 **active Inj.** of choice and be at 1 **HP**; Alternatively, avoid a narratively-driven death. The **GM** will decide the character's alternative fate. They could be captured, very badly injured or become indebted to someone or something. |
| 1 AFP   | Yes, my liege      | Work with your **GM** to create a follower/hireling who will now be at your command/employ. |

# Combat
When diplomacy fails, hostilities ensue. 

## Who Acts When
At the beginning of every combat encounter, the involved parties (= groups) must roll for initiative. In order to determine which party gets to act first, each party rolls a **1D6**. The party rolling the higher number, goes first. If there is a tie, roll a **1D2**. If the player party is involved, a one means they get to go first. 

The involved parties act one after another. After all involed parties have had their **turn** to act, a **combat round** has passed. All members of a party act at the same time, during the party's turn. 

If one party is surprised, the ambushing party gets to act for a full turn, without initiative being rolled. This is called a *surprise round*. After the surprise round, initiative is rolled and combat begins as explained above. A party is considered surprised if they were unaware of their opponents when the first attack roll happens. 

> As an example: this does not count for opponents standing right in front of each other in conversation, when one of them suddenly draws a dagger and attacks. The attacker can be clearly seen by the defender and thus they must both roll for initiative, to determine whether the defender can react in time. 

## Combat Actions
Every turn, every character gets 3 **Action Points (AP)** to spend on actions during their turn. 

Any basic action, so any action not requiring a test, costs 1 **AP**. Any action requiring a test, costs 2 **AP**. 

This means that generally, one attack and one movement can be made, per turn. 

A character can move up to 15'/5m per **AP** spent. In **difficult terrain**, the distance moved per **AP** is 6'/2m. 

Speaking or shouting a short phrase is free. If you want to have a proper conversation, that will have to take multiple rounds. 

Whenever an **exhausting action** is made, the character gains one point of [exhaustion](#exhaustion).

If the turn is ended with any **AP** unspent, they go towards the character's [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi) and [ranged defence](#ranged-defence-agi), as **+1D6** per **AP**. 

## How to Attack
All attacks made against another creature or character are made as an [opposed test](#opposed-test). 

* When attacking with a weapon: 
  * It is possible to fork other weapon skills into the attack roll. 
  * The [weapon skill](#weapon--weapon-type--str) of choice must be rolled as a [graduated test](#graduated-test). 
    * If it is a melee attack, the defender must roll a [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi) [graduated test](#graduated-test). 
    * If it is a ranged attack, the defender must roll a [ranged defence](#ranged-defence-agi) [graduated test](#graduated-test).
* When attacking with magic:
  * It is **not** possible to fork other magic skills into the attack roll. 
  * The mage must roll the specific [magic school](#magic-school--school--arc) as a [graduated test](#graduated-test).
  * The defender can either roll a [ranged defence](#ranged-defence-agi) [graduated test](#graduated-test)...
  * ...or they can roll a [magic school](#magic-school--school--arc) [graduated test](#graduated-test) of their own, to try and counter the attack. 
* Whoever has more successes, wins the [opposed test](#opposed-test). 
  * If the attacker wins, they can roll the [injuries](#injury) to inflict. That number is then reduced by [resistances and armor](#damage-resistances). The final number of injuries is then applied to the defender. 
  * If the defender wins or the result is a tie, the attack fails and no [injuries](#injury) are inflicted. 

### Types of Attack
Sometimes, simply *hitting it* isn't enough. Sometimes, more control is needed. These rules outline how a character can do more specific attacks. 

#### Aimed Attack
An attack generally targets the center of mass (torso) of the targeted opponent. 

It is, however, possible to call out wanting to attack a specific part of an opponent's body. Generally, this means that the attack must be rolled with [disadvantage](#advantage--disadvantage). However, the **GM** can also decide the part being targeted is fairly easy to hit, either generally or due to current circumstance, so no disadvantage is incurred. 

A player may call out what effect the aimed attack is supposed to have, such as limiting their opponent's ability to stand, move, attack or whatever else the body part may be useful for. If they don't, the **GM** decides the effect. 

#### Difficult Attack
There may be attacks that are more difficult to perform, due to current circumstance. Such attack rolls are [disadvantaged](#advantage--disadvantage). 

An example for a *difficult attack* would be targeting an opponent with a ranged weapon when the opponent is behind cover. 

Another example would be attacking backwards, at an invisible target or with a broken arm, and so on.

#### Easy Attack
Some attacks may be easier to perform. An **easy attack** is [advantaged](#advantage--disadvantage).

The following are generally considered easy attacks (but at the **GM**'s discretion):
* From behind
* Against prone opponents
* Against restrained opponents

#### Execution Attack
The extreme version of an easy attack, the **execution attack** allows outright killing or maiming an opponent, without having to roll for an attack or for damage. 

Such an attack can be carried out against any character who is unable to resist (with the exception of player characters, see [death's door](#deaths-door)). 

> An unconscious character, or one chained to the wall couldn't possibly resist and can be instantaneously killed with an **execution attack**. 

This kind of attack is only possible at the **GM**'s discretion. 

# Magic
Any character with [arcana](#arcana-arc), can cast magic. What kind of magic, depends on the [magic schools](#magic-schools) the character knows. 

While not all spells can be used offensively, those that can, will inflict [damage](#health--exhaustion), proportional to the [spell's intensity](#spell-intensity) and may cause other effects on those affected by it. 

The effects of a spell do not affect the mage casting the spell, unless they suffer a [spell backfire](#spell-backfire). 

## Spell Intensity
Any magic can be cast at different **intensities**. A greater **spell intensity** results in a greater effect, at a proportionally greater cost. 

## Maximum Spell Intensity
A mage can only cast spells at an intensity up to a maximum, called their **maximum spell intensity**. This number directly correlates to their skill in the type of [magic school](#magic-schools) they wish to use. 

This means, for every [school of magic](#magic-schools) the mage knows, they may have a different **maximum spell intensity**. 

## Spell Backfire
If a test to cast magic isn't a **complete success**, the spell **backfires** and applies its effects and damage to the caster, instead. The intensity at which it hits the caster, is the number of **negatives** they rolled below the intended **intensity**. 

**Backfire intensity** = **intensity** - **positives**

> A pyromancer with a [pyromancy](#pyromancy) skill of 4 and [arcana](#arcana-arc) of 3 chooses to cast their magic at intensity level 4. They have to roll 4 **positives**, in order to completely succeed. They get to roll **7D6** for this test. Unfortunately, they fail, having rolled only 2 **positives**. The spell **backfires**, at an intensity of 2. 

## Casting Magic
In order to cast magic, a mage has to roll a skill test in a [magic school](#magic-schools) of choice: 
* If they roll a **complete success**, the spell goes off as planned, at the intended [intensity](#spell-intensity). 
* If they roll a **partial success** or a **complete failure**, the spell [backfires](#spell-backfire), with an intensity equal to the number of **negatives** rolled. 

Any damage rolls or other effects are then made and applied to the target/self. 

After that, the mage has to roll the amount of [exhaustion](#exhaustion) they gain from casting the spell. To do so, they must roll **ND3**, where *N* is the **spell intensity** they cast the spell at. 

The amount of [exhaustion](#exhaustion) gained is then reduced by their **magic exhaustion resistance**, which is governed by their [arcana](#arcana-arc) attribute, plus their skill in the related [magic school](#magic-schools). 

[Exhaustion](#exhaustion) gain cannot be reduced to less than one. That means, whenever a mage casts a spell, they gain *at least* one point of [exhaustion](#exhaustion). 

## Magic Schools
Noted for each spell intensity, are the effects of the spell and the maximum distance, from the caster, at which the spell can be cast or the distance up to which it can have an effect. 

If applicable, damage inflicted, exhaustion inflicted and other such effects, will also be noted. 

### Pyromancy
The summoning and control of fire. The flame being a destructive force, pyromancers enjoy little utility from their magic, beyond the ability to create light. 

Injuries inflicted are of the [burning](#burning) damage type. 

| Spell Intensity | Damage Inflicted | Max Distance | Effect(s) |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | --------- |
| 1  | 1D3 **Burning** | 0      | A small, controlled flame erupts and stays in the mage's hand. Alternatively, a small flame (like a candle flame) in immediate proximity of the mage is extinguished. |
| 2  | 2D3 **Burning** | 3'/1m  | A moderate torch fire erupts and stays in the mage's hand. Or a torch in immediate proximity of the mage is extinguished. |
| 3  | 3D3 **Burning** | 15'/5m | A ball of fire forms in the mage's hand, ready to be flung at a nearby spot, dealing its damage in a 6'/2m radius. Or a decent-sized flame is extinguished nearby. |
| 4  | 4D3 **Burning** | 15'/5m | A static wall or column of flame erupts in a nearby spot of the mage's choosing, covering up to a 12'/4m square. Alternatively, a nearby flame (wall) is redirected. |
| 5  | 5D3 **Burning** | 24'/8m | Flame shoots out of the mage's hand in a steady stream, covering a moderate distance and causing its damage in a straight line. Everything caught in the line takes the damage. Or another mage's stream of flame is redirected. |
| 6+ | ND3 **Burning** | 24'/8m | N = spell intensity; Causes a spot of the mage's choosing at moderate distance to explode, causing its damage in a radius of 15'/5m. |

### Cryomancy
The summoning and control of ice. Besides the frostbite, cryomancer's can inflict [exhaustion](#exhaustion) on opponents, or freeze things, so they're harder to break. 

Injuries inflicted are of the [freezing](#freezing) damage type. 

| Spell Intensity | Damage Inflicted | Exhaustion Inflicted | Max Distance | Effect(s) |
| --------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 1  | 0   | 0   | 0     | Any freezable liquid in the mage's hand immediately freezes. Doesn't work on living things. So no freezing of the blood in someone's veins, while they still live! |
| 2  | 1D3 **Freezing** | 1   | 3'/1m | A spot of the mage's choosing, within hand's reach, freezes over. |
| 3  | 1D3 **Freezing** | 1D3 | 15'/5m | An ice-shard forms from whatever liquid is in the mage's hands. It can be shot at a nearby spot of the mage's choosing. The impacted spot freezes over. |
| 4  | 2D3 **Freezing** | 2D3 | 24'/8m | A large ice-shard forms in the mage's hands, without requiring any liquid. It can be shot at a moderately distant spot of the mage's choosing. The impacted spot freezes over. |
| 5  | 2D3 **Freezing** | 1D6 | 24'/8m | A large area of the mage's choosing, at moderate distance from the mage, freezes over. |
| 6+ | N-3 D3 **Freezing** | 1D6 + N-5 | 24'/8m | N = spell intensity; A torrent of ice and snow forms in a large area of the mage's choosing, at moderate distance. Anything within it, freezes over. |

### Restoration
The mending of injuries and treatment of diseases. 

| Spell Intensity | Injuries Patched Up | Max Distance | Effect(s) |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| 1               | 1                | 0            | A creature of the mage's choosing, in hand's reach, is magically healed. Removes [bleeding](#bleeding). |
| 2+              | N                | 0            | N = spell intensity; Up to two creatures of the mage's choosing, in hand's reach, are magically healed. Removes [bleeding](#bleeding) and [poisoned](#poisoned). |
| 6+              | 0                | 0            | N = spell intensity; A single **Inj.** of choice becomes **treated**. Removes [bleeding](#bleeding) and [poisoned](#poisoned). |

## Magic Things

### Abyssalite
Abyssalite is a hard and brittle mineral, that has the ability to *amplify the flow of magic*. It can only be acquired from the depths of the earth and is fairly rare. 

Its surface is unnaturally smooth and covered in a fine, iridescent shine. Underneath the smooth surface, one searches for depth and color in vain. It is as though the void itself was being contained by that iridescent shell. 

Abyssalite is a hard and brittle mineral, prone to shattering if too much force is applied. This makes it difficult to shape. It is also fairly heavy, which makes it difficult to lug large amounts of it around. 

A decent-sized Abyssalite chunk has a weight of three. It grants one greater [spell intensity](#spell-intensity), but without costing any [exhaustion](#exhaustion). 

### Amberite
As magic is amplified by [Abyssalite](#abyssalite), its antithesis is called **Amberite**, a metal which dulls the effects of magic and slows any magic flow nearby it. The material is also known to affect magic creatures and can cause great pain in magic-users. 

Weapons made from Amberite are quite popular with witch and monster hunters alike, although fairly hard to come by, due to the difficulty in amber-iron processing. 

Amberite is a crystalline material, that can be molten down and shaped, like iron. It glows weakly, in the fiery orange of the name-sharing amber stone. Near the edges, the glow fades to a dull reflection, like cooling molten glass. 

It only occurs naturally in a few select places in the world, where the ground offers the right conditions. Amberite grows over time, in the right environment. It can take several decades for a finger-sized crystal to grow to the size of an adult man's forearm. Attempts to cultivate it have mostly failed, as Amberite farmers have so far been unable to understand and reproduce the right conditions for it to thrive. Due to the slow rate at which it grows, an Amberite farmer may not realize the lack of growth until well into a decade later. 

Prolonged exposure to Amberite causes severe ill-effects with nausea and migranes being common symptoms. 

### Ambersteel
Amberite can be processed into Ambersteel, which makes it a usable metal. The raw material heats slowly and must be heated over the course of several days and nights, without interruption. When it finally reaches the right temperature, it will glow white, with a purple sheen. At that point, it can be hammered into shape. Constant re-heating ensures it stays at the right temperature and a final quenching in vegetable oil ensures it retains its flexibility. 

If processed outside the optimal temperature, the material quickly grows brittle and will shatter if any stress is put on it.

Due to the length of the process and the difficulty in keeping the right temperature, smiths capable of working amber-iron are rare. 

### Runes
Shards of [Abyssalite](#abyssalite) can have runes carved into them, which allow magic to flow through the runes. This renders runes extremely powerful artifacts, as they can allow for near limitless magic-use, even in the hands of a non-mage. 

To activate such a rune, is a difficult skill to learn, however. Even if no innate magical ability is required, an understanding of the flow of magic is. The rune must be touched in the right spots, at the right intervals, to activate successfully. Mistakes in this procedure can have disastrous results. 

What's more, it takes great skill to carve the right runes, as each rune's shape and complexity depends in part on the size and shape of the [Abyssalite](abyssalite) shard. The only way to get it right, is to *feel* the way the rune must be shaped. Alternatively, the shard can be adjusted to be of equivalent size and shape, but this requires considerable effort, as [Abyssalite](abyssalite) is a tough material, prone to shattering if too much force is applied, yet resistant to the common techniques of metallurgy. 

In order to craft a **rune**:
* A **rune** can only be made to cast one type of magic. So the carver has to pick one of the [magic schools](#magic-schools). 
* The maximum **level** at which a **rune** can be created, depends on the carver's skill. The **level** of the **rune** dictates the [spell intensity](#spell-intensity) it will cast its spell at. 
* The carver has to succeed a [rune carving](#rune-carving-arc) skill test. 
  * If they fail, the carving is botched and the [Abyssalite chunk](#abyssalite) cannot be used for another carving attempt. There is no room for mistakes. 

In order to invoke a **rune**:
* A **complete success** of a [rune-using](#rune-using-agi) skill test will invoke the spell of the **rune** as expected.
* A **partial success** or **complete failure** results in a [spell backfire](#spell-backfire).
