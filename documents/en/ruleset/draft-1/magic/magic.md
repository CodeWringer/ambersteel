# Magic
Magically affine individuals may cast any spells that they know and have memorized. Casting spells costs stamina points. 

Exhausting one's stamina points by casting spells incurs a hefty cost to one's health. 

## Spell Intensity
Every spell can be cast at a certain intensity level, of at least 1. Each intensity level both increases the intensity and cost by increasing the number of rolls for each. 

## Spell Memory
How many spells a character can memorize is governed by a mix of their arcana and wisdom. 

A character gets to memorize one spell for every five points in their arcana and wisdom combined. 

## Maintained Spells
Some spells can be cast over an extended period of time. Generally, the longer a spell is maintained, the harder it will become to resist the strain of magic flowing through their body.
