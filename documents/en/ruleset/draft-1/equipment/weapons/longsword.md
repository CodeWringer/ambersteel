### Fencing stance
The weapon attribute becomes the wielder's dexterity. 

> The swordsman assumes a sideways stance, holding their weapon in a defensive position, making guiding their weapon easier. 

### Bull stance
The weapon attribute becomes the wielder's strength. 

> The swordsman assumes a wide stance, with sword held high, allowing strong sweeps with the blade. 

### Mordhau stance
The weapon attribute becomes the wielder's strength. 

The weapon deals 1d10 (+ [Str-Mod](../../attributes#strength-[str])) blunt damage instead. 

Suffers a [precision modifier](../../combat/combat-attributes#Precision-[Prec]) penalty of 2. 

> The swordsman flips his sword around and strikes with hilt and pommel, instead of the blade.
