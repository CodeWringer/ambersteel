# Weapon Attributes

## Two-Handed
The weapon must be wielded with both hands, restricting the use of any off-hand equipment. 

This also disallows the use of regular shields. There may be shields that are strapped to the arm, but these will generally incur further stamina cost and [precision modifier](../../combat/combat-attributes#Precision-[Prec]) penalties. 

## Unbalanced
An unbalanced weapon costs an additional stamina point for all actions involving that weapon and incurs a parry penalty. 

## Long Reach
Also allows striking from further away. 
Allows striking over equally tall characters without penalty. 

## Static Reload
A ranged weapon with the static reload attribute disallows moving or performing other actions between reloading and shooting. 

A reload ending the turn is allowed, but at the beginning of the following turn, the character must either shoot or abandon their previous reload. Spent reload stamina cost is not recouped.
