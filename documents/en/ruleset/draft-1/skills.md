# Skills
All of a character's skills have a value attached to them, which governs that character's proficiencies. 

Skills can be improved over time. Every time a roll for a skill is made, the outcome will be noted. Whenever a certain threshold of successes and failures is passed, the skill improves. Both successes _and_ failures must be accumulated to grow a skill. 

The following list does not and cannot aim to be a complete listing of all possible skills in game. Adding new skills as necessary will have to be done by the GM.
