# Weapon
Weapons as tools of murder and self-defense are indispensable to any adventurer and have several properties that define their strengths and weaknesses. 

## Reliant attribute
All weapons rely on either dexterity or strength. 

If relying on strength and having rolled a successful attack, add or subtract the [strength modifier](../attributes#strength-[str]) value to each of the weapon's damage types marked with (+ [Str-Mod](../attributes#strength-[str])). 

If instead relying on dexterity, add or subtract the [precision modifier](combat-attributes#Precision-[Prec]) value to the roll result. 

## Classes
There are different weapon classes, representing the weapon's capabilities. 

### Unarmed
This class is special, in that it isn't an actual weapon class. 

It is not possible to parry any non-unarmed attack. 

### Light
A light weapon is typically small and one-handed, relying on their wielder's dexterity, not costing particularly much stamina but also not dealing a lot of damage. 

### Medium
Medium weapons may be both one-handed, as well as two-handed weapons, that usually strike a good balance between stamina cost and damage output. 

### Heavy
Heavy weapons are usually two-handed, that cost a lot of stamina to wield, but deal significant damage, even to armored opponents. 

### Super-Heavy
Super-heavy weapons are usually two-handed and unbalanced weapons, that can easily crush through most parries and deal lethal damage to an unprepared opponent. 

## Range Type
Weapons can have be of one or more of the following ranged types. 

### Melee
A close-range weapon. 

### Ranged
A ranged weapon, that can be used to attack from a distance, out of melee range. 

Ranged weapons can only be discharged up to a certain distance away, as determined by the specific weapon. 

Ranged weapons must usually be reloaded after a shot, which may require time and will require ammunition. 

### Thrown
A weapon that can be thrown. 

Thrown weapons can only be thrown up to a certain distance away, as determined by the specific weapon. 

## Damage
All weapons have one or more damage types they're capable of. 

## Stamina Damage
All weapons deal a certain amount of damage to the stamina of the opponent hit. 

## Stamina Cost
It costs stamina to attack and parry with weapons. These are separate, fixed values. 

## Stances
Many weapons may allow their wielder to change stance, allowing the weapon to be used in a different way or giving it different properties.
