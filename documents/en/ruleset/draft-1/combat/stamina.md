# Stamina Points [SP]
All combat actions use up stamina points. 

Stamina points are a resource, that must be managed during combat. Certain character skills may help restore stamina points faster. 

Acting past one's limits is possible, but will lead to [overexertion](status-effects#overexerted). When their stamina points reach 0, a character will become overexerted. 

Value range: 0 - 40

## Taking a breather
Characters can only regain stamina by taking a breather, which means not committing to an active combat action for a turn. 

The amount recovered is governed by their [endurance](../attributes#endurance-[end]). 

Stamina point regen rate range: 1 - 10
