# Damage Types
There are different damage types, that weapons and abilities may be associated with. 

## Direct
Direct damage bypasses all armor and directly damages a character's [health points](combat-attributes#health-points-[hp]).

## Slash
A lethal damage type associated with sharp-edged weapons, designed to fight at most lightly armored opponents. 

Usually associated with bladed weapons. 

## Pierce
A lethal damage type usually associated with sharp, penetrating weapons designed to pierce armor or the weak spots in armor. 

Successful attacks with this damage type degrade the [condition](armor#Condition) of the armor hit, thus reducing its effectiveness. 

Usually associated with thrusting or spiked weapons. 

## Blunt
This is the only non-lethal damage type. 

A character taken down to 1 or less [health points](combat-attributes#health-points-[hp]) with a blunt type attack, will instead of being brought to [death's door](combat-attributes#Death's-door), be knocked [unconscious](status-effects#unconscious). 

Usually associated with blunt-edged, medium one-handed weapons.

## Crush
This is the lethal version of blunt damage. Capable of breaking bones and internal organs, even through armor. 

Successful attacks with this damage type degrade the [condition](armor#Condition) of the armor hit, thus reducing its effectiveness. 

Usually associated with heavy, unwieldy weapons. 

## Poison
Poison is both a damage type, as well as a status effect. A poisoned character will take additional poison damage at the start of each of their turns. 

## Burn
Burn is both a damage type, as well as a status effect. A burning character will take additional burning damage at the start of each of their turns.
