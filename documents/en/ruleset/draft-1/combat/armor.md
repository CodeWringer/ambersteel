# Armor
Armor provides flat damage reduction for one or more [types of damage](damage-types). Heavier armor provides better protections, but also further increases stamina cost penalties for all actions. 

## Encumbrance
Armor adds [encumbrance](encumbrance) points to a character wearing it. 

## Protection
Armor provides flat damage reductions, for certain damage types. 

The amount of damage reduction and for which types of damage is determined by each armor piece in question. 

## Condition
An armor has *condition points*, which describe the condition it is in. As the condition of an armor decreases, the more its protectiveness decreases. 

Every armor has a current and a maximum number of condition points, as noted on each armor. For each condition point lost, a certain amount of protections is lost. This number is detailed on each armor. 

As armor is hit, if the damage type is [pierce](damage-types#pierce) or [crush](damage-types#crush), the armor will take damage, reducing the condition points it has by one, each time it is hit. 

Armor condition cannot be reduced to less than 1 condition point. 

Every successful attack of an armor damaging type reduces the top-most armor's condition by one point. An armor whose condition points reaches 1, is considered *broken*. A broken piece of armor exposes the next layer of armor below it, which is at that point considered the top-most armor. 

The top-most armor is that set of worn armor, that is next in the reverse order of armor layers, that has a condition of greater than 1. 

Condition points are reduced only __after__ a succesful attack with an armor damaging type. 

Armor condition points can be restored through the use of appropriate skills, such as any of the smithing skills, and normally, cannot be done during combat. You may make a corresponding skill check for as many times as you like, keeping in mind that every attempt costs time, the extent of which is up to the game master. A good reference point would be a half an hour for simple repairs up to several hours. Additionally, repairs require materials and tools. 

## Layers
Armor may potentially be layered. While it won't be possible to wear two plate cuirasses over one another, it very much will be possible to wear chain mail underneath a plate cuirass. 

Each armor has a layer value associated with it. It is impossible to wear two pieces of armor on the same layer. 

## Classes
The armor classes determine the overall coverage and protection level of the armor, as well as additional stamina costs. 

### None
Anything not explicitly protective, like regular street clothes. 

### Light
Light armor does not incur any stamina penalties, but also provides the least damage reduction. 

### Medium
Medium armor provides a good balance of damage reductions and encumbrance. 

### Heavy
Heavy armor provides excellent protection, at the cost of greater encumbrance. 

### Super Heavy
Super Heavy armor provides outstanding protection, but also causes extreme encumbrance.
