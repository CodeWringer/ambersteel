## Encumbrance
For each two points of encumbrance, a character gains one point of *encumbrance stamina penalty* (EsP). For any action that requires stamina, the encumbrance stamina penalty must be added to the action's stamina cost. 

Every two points of encumbrance adds 1 point of penalty to a [dodge](combat-attributes#Dodge) roll.
