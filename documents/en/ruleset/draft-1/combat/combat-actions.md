# Combat Actions
During combat, a character's possible actions are represented by the following types. 

It is possible to perform one of each of these actions during combat. 

It is possible to turn a movement action into a standard action, which disallows movement but allows two standard actions in a turn. It is not possible to use up less than the full movement and then still convert the movement action. One may only convert the __full__ movement action to a standard action. 

## Standard Action
Any attack or other major action is considered a standard action. 

A weapon whose reload speed is at least medium takes a standard action to reload. 

## Quick Action
Changing stance, drawing a weapon or reloading a fast to reload weapon count as quick actions. 

## Bonus Action
Under certain circumstances, a bonus action is possible, which is usually tied to a special weapon, skill or trait. 

## Movement Action
A character can choose to move before or after taking any other action. 

A character can move up to their [speed](../attributes#Speed-[Spd]) in meters (speed * 3 feet) and at least 1 meter (or 3 feet), unless [grappled](status-effects#grappled) or [restrained](status-effects#restrained). 

Movement does not have to be taken all at once. It is possible to perform other actions in between moving, but the total distance moved at the end of the turn must not exceed the limit described previously. 

## Overdrive Action
An overdrive action is a special action that are restricted in how many times they can be used. 

These are generally special and powerful or unique actions.
