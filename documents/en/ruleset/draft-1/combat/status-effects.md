# Status Effects
Characters can incur status effects, that may have adverse effects on their ability to act during combat. 

## Unconscious
Unable to act, no ability to sense or think. 

Can only be broken from, without help, by spending a [full rest](../resting#full-rest). 

Can be broken from, with help, through certain magic or a successful [medicine check](../skills#Medicine-(Int-+-Wis-+-Perc)) by an aiding character. 

## Staggered
Causes disadvantage to any skill checks relying on dexterity, as well as attack and dodge rolls. 

If hit by another stagger, turns into a stun, instead. 

## Stunned
Unable to sense or act. Must succeed a [constitution](../attributes#constitution-[con]) saving throw to remove the status. 

## Overexerted
Incurred when a character's remaining [stamina points](combat-attributes#Stamina-Points-[SP]) reaches 0. 

Disadvantage on all rolls. 

Losing any more stamina results in the character falling prone, unless they succeed a disadvantaged endurance check. 

If already prone, and continuing to lose stamina, a character will fall unconscious, unless they succeed a disadvantaged endurance check. 

This status is only removed after passing two full rounds of not spending more than half of the regained stamina points. Or, out of combat, after spending at least a [short rest](../resting#short-rest). 

## Prone
A prone character is a character that has either been knocked to the ground or who has lied down. 

All melee attacks have advantage against an opponent who is considered prone, if the attacker was aware of the opponent's presence. 

For example, a guard inspecting a wagon carrying hay may choose to randomly stab in the hay with their spear. They are unaware of a smuggled criminal lying prone on the wagon, covered by the hay. Therefore, the guard does not, in fact, get advantage on their attack roll. 

It takes a [movement action](combat-actions#movement-action) to stand up from prone. 

## Grappled
A grappled character is unable to move of their own volition. They are held in place. 

It takes a strength check to break free from a grapple. 

A grappled character can still make attempts to attack or defend. 

## Restrained
A restrained character is unable to move, attack or defend. They are held in place in a way that prevents them from attacking or defending, for example by chains around their wrists, connected to a wall. 

If simply held down by another opponent, like a grapple, then they can break free via a strength check.
