# Types of tests

## Binary
Success or failure is absolute, with no room for interpretation. 

The skill or attribute to test is determined by the GM. 

## Graduated
Success or failure can be graduated. The level of success affects the quality of the outcome positively or the level of failure allows for a "failing forward" - a success, but with a complication. 

The skill or attribute to test is determined by the GM. 

## Creative
Also known as a skill challenge, this type of test asks a player to pick and justify the skill(s) to use in a given situation. 

The GM must allow the use of the skill(s) in question, but does not dictate which ones to use. 

# Attribute test
1d20 <= attribute value

# Skill test
1d100 <= skill value

2. Take the sum of the relevant attributes divided by three and round down. 
3. Add skill value and attribute modifiers sum. 
1. Roll 1d100
4. If the rolled value is less than or equal to the sum, you succeed. 

An Example: A player is asked to make an acrobatics skill test. 
1. Their character's acrobatics skill is 30. 
1. Their character's dexterity is 8, strength 14 and constitution 18. Addings these values, they get a 40. 
1. They divide the 40 by three and round down, yielding a 13 (instead of 13.33...).
1. Adding 13 and 30, the skill test threshold becomes a 43. This means the player must roll a 43 or less in order to succeed their roll. 
1. They roll 1d100, and achieve a 41. 
1. They have succeeded the skill test!

## Hint
Since attributes don't change often, after character creation, writing down your attribute sums for each skill can make your math easier ahead of time, as you only have to look at the already divided and rounded down sum.
