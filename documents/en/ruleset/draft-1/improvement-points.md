# Improvement Points (IP)
Improvement points -  or **IP**, for short - are the *meta-currency* which can be used to improve a character's attributes. 

IP are not meant to be earned, but rather awarded by the GM. These points could be awarded after players complete an adventure, a dungeon or a campaign. The amount to award should be reasonable, reflecting the hardships endured, but not so much as to allow a character huge jumps in attribute values. 

An average IP reward for a completed adventure of short to medium length should be around 20. 

## IP Cost Table
In the following table, the cost denoted for an attribute value represents the [Improvement Point](improvement-points) cost for the jump from the current attribute value to the next one.

### Example
Susanne has a character with a strength value of 10 and wants to increase that value. That means she needs to pay 2700 IP in order to get her character to strength 11. 

From previous adventures she already accumulated 2000 IP. Completing another adventure, she is awarded 800 IP. Now having 2800 IP, she has more than enough to improve her character's strength. She proceeds, spending 2700 IP and retaining the 100 IP that were left over. 

Her character now has a strength of 11. In order to get to 12, she would now need 3500 IP, of which she already has 100.
