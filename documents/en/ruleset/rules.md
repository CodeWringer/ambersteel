Version 0.6 "Abyssalite"

A role-playing game by Nicolas Haase

# Introduction
**Ambersteel** is a table-top role-playing game (**TTRPG**), requiring a **game master** (**GM**) and at least one **player** to play. 

On the spectrum of *narrative-driven*, *game-y* and *simulationist*, **Ambersteel** aims for the region between *game-y* and *narrative-driven*, while leaning more towards *game-y*:
* Combat is a risky affair and requires tactical and strategic thinking, or the readiness to retreat, when things go awry. When a character suffers **injuries**, they are in *serious trouble*. 
* Magic is also a risky affair, with a chance for a spell to fail and affect the mage, instead. The chance of success is manageable, however. 
* Players are also expected to manage resources, such as their character's health and possessions. Character's are neither *damage sponges*, nor *item vacuums*. 
* **PC** change and roleplaying are embedded into the rules. There are no classes or other arbitrary restrictions on what a character can do. **Attributes** and **skills** improve as they are used, incentivising experimentation. Characters have long-term and short-term goals and beliefs, which drive them onward and which change over time. 
* **PC**s aren't expected to start powerful and skilled. But they're expected to become powerful and skilled over the course of a long campaign. 

While each player only controls a single character, the **GM** is in control of every single non-player character (**NPC**), the world and the story. A player character is abbreviated as **PC**. 

The system is designed to fit a low to medium fantasy medieval setting. 

The rules are designed to be as intuitive and simple as possible, while complex enough to allow players to make meaningful choices. 

Most rules will have a certain degree of vagueness to them. This is at least partially deliberate. The situations that can come up during play are simply too varied and numerous to be possible to completely cover with rules, without requiring epic tomes filled to the brim with highly specific rulings for highly specific situations. Instead, the game relies on the **GM** to arbitrate in every situation. The descriptions in the rules here should serve as a point of orientation for the **GM**. How they interpret the rules, is how they're to be understood. 

Despite the focus on tactical and deadly combat, this is not an *adversarial* game. The **GM** and the players work ***together*** to create a unique experience and weave a story of glorious triumph, tragic defeat or anything in-between. Ultimately, the **GM**'s job is to provide interesting conundrums to the players and their job is to provide interesting answers, in-line with what their characters believe. What's important to remember is that the **GM** is a *player*, too. They're here to have fun and enjoy their time at the table, too. That is why it's important to work ***together***. 

# Credits
**Ambersteel** is not a revolution of the RPG genre and it was never meant to be. It is an amalgam and consolidation of rules I found to my liking, topped off with minor inventions of my own, in hopes of crafting a deep, yet intuitive system. 

As such, I took inspiration from other systems I have read, played and enjoyed in the past:
* **The Burning Wheel**, by Luke Crane and Dan Abram
* **Zweihänder**, by Daniel D. Fox
* **Knave**, by Ben Milton

## How to Play
As **Ambersteel** is a **roleplaying game**, there are certain rules and expectations of both players and **GM**. 

In some places, where distances are concerned, both feet and meters are noted as units. What attentive readers will notice, is that the conversion between the numbers won't always be correct. This is a deliberate decision to make the math easier, whenever a grid (or *battlemap*) is used in play. One square on the grid should represent either a three foot, or one meter square. Furthermore, a single, ordinary human, should occupy an entire such square. 

### Dice
**Ambersteel** uses a **dice pool** system of **six-sided dice** (henceforth referred to as **D6**) to resolve [tests](#tests). *Dice pool* means a variable number of dice will be rolled, based on a character's [attributes](#attributes), [skills](#skills), boons and circumstance of the situation they're in. 

The following types of dice come into play:
* **D3** - three-sided dice
* **D4** - four-sided dice
* **D6** - six-sided dice
* **D10** (**D100**) - two ten-sided dice

### Before the Game
Before anyone can start to play, the players have to [create their characters](#character-creation). Ideally, this process should be done in cooperation with the **GM** and each other, to make sure the character concepts fit into the world and planned narrative. Also, it is advisable to design characters that will work well together, as a group. 

### The Session
This is the time, when the magic happens. The players and **GM** have come together and begin or continue the story. 

[Fate points](#fate-points) cannot be awarded during play and neither can cards be bought from the [hand of fate](#hand-of-fate). However, players and the **GM** should take note of every situation they believe a **PC** (their own included) could have earned a [fate point](#fate-points).

### After the Session
After a playing session is done, the players and **GM** should stick around to discuss which players earned [fate points](#fate-points). This is where players are nominated for [fate points](#fate-points), by each other and by the **GM**. If everyone agrees, the [fate points](#fate-points) are awarded. Players can and should lobby for their [fate points](#fate-points), but shouldn't beg. If most everyone else says no, then that decision stands. That doesn't mean there is no point in discussing the matter further, but such a discussion shoulnd't be forced. 

Also after the session, players and the **GM** discuss whether a **PC** should lose an [instinct](#instincts), because they have acted against it or haven't gotten to play it out at all. 

Any time in between sessions, players can spend [fate points](#fate-points) to buy cards (boons) from the [hand of fate](#hand-of-fate). 

## Tests
Whenever the outcome of an action or situation is uncertain, a **test** may be called for by the **GM**, in order to resolve it. 

As a basis for a test, either an [attribute](#attributes) or [skill](#skills) is used. 

Either a **six** or a **five** rolled on a single die counts as a **positive**. Other values are considered **negatives**. **Positives** are required in order to succeed a test. 

How many **positives** are needed to succeed a test, is determined by the **GM**, via a mechanism called **obstacle** (henceforth referred to as **Ob**). The test can only succeed, if at least as many **positives** are rolled, as the **Ob** named by the **GM**. 

> For example, to succeed a test at **Ob 3**, at least three **positives** must be rolled to succeed the test. Any less, and the test outcome is a failure. 

To resolve an **attribute test**, the number of **D6** indicated by the *attribute level* (the number next to the attribute) must be rolled. 

To resolve a **skill test**, the number of **D6** indicated by the **skill level** (the number next to the skill), plus half of the related **attribute** (rounded down) as additional dice must be rolled. 

> A **PC** has an [agility](#agility-agi) of 3 and an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) skill at level 2. The player is asked to roll a test for [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) at **Ob** 2. They get to roll 1 + 2 = 3 **D6**, if they don't have any other skills to [fork](#skill-forking) into the test. 

A [skill being learned](#learning-skills) is tested with *only* half of the related **attribute** (rounded down). 

For every test, one of three outcomes is possible: 
* **Complete Success**: There are enough or even more than required **positives**.
* **Partial Success**: There are not enough **positives**, but more than none. 
* **Complete Failure**: There are no **positives**, only **negatives**. 

### Types of Test
There are the following types of tests. The **GM** decides when each type of test is appropriate. 

#### Binary Test
The outcome of the test is either a **complete success** or **complete failure**. A **partial success** is treated as if it were a **complete failure**. 

#### Stepped Test
A stepped test is really just a series of [binary tests](#binary-test). This allows for finer-grained results, while still not behaving like a [graduated test](#graduated-test). 

This type of test is useful for situations where the **GM** decides to create very fine *time slices* and allow more chances for success. This makes it easier to allow a **PC** to *fail forward* or prevent a *one roll to end it all* situation. 

> For example, a **PC** is attempting to cross a suspension bridge, but upon setting foot on the bridge, the ropes holding it up, suddenly snap. The **PC** can make an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test, to try and quickly jump off and back onto solid ground. They fail, and get to make another [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test at greater **Ob**, to try and grab a root sticking out of the ground beneath the bridge. They fail again! As a last chance for that **PC** to survive, the **GM** asks one of the other players if their character will attempt an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test at high **Ob**, to try and grab their falling ally's hand in a daring rescue. Finally, their ally succeeds and the **PC**'s life is saved. 
> 
> Obviously, such a situation should not arise often, as stepped tests can quickly grow exasperating. 

#### Graduated Test
The outcome of the test is graduated. That means, the number of **positives** rolled during the test factor into the outcome. This is called the **degree of success**. 

> For example, when crafting a work of art, the number of **positives** achieved may result in a more impressive piece, which can then be sold at a higher price or which could make for a more impressive gift. 

On the other hand, failure doesn't have to be absolute. The degree of failure can allow for a "failing forward" - a success, but with complications, whose severity depends on the number of failures. 

#### Creative Test
Also known as a **skill challenge**, this type of test asks the player(s) to pick and justify the skill(s) or attribute to use in a given situation. Players are encouraged to think creatively, come up with and describe their solutions. 

Whether the attribute or skill(s) in question can apply to resolve the situation at hand, lies at the **GM**'s discretion. 

#### Opposed Test
Also known as a *versus test*, this type of test occurs, when two characters come into opposition. Who wins, and by how much, is determined by comparing the number of **positives** of each character. The one with the most **positives** is the winner. 

In order to even stand a chance of winning an **opposed test**, the **attacker** has to also achieve a **complete success**. 

If there is a tie, the **defending** character is considered the winner. 

The terms of **attacker** and **defender** refer to the character initiating and the character reacting to the **opposed test**, respectively. 

> For example, a character tries to sneak past another, the sneaking character will have to succeed a [stealth](#stealth-agi) test, while the other character will have to succeed an [observation](#observation-perc) test. If the result is a tie, the one making the observation test is considered the **defender**, and wins. 

If a tie occurs in which a **defender** cannot be clearly determined, the result is a deadlock and neither side gains anything. 

### Providing Assistance
Characters can help each other in tests. In order to help with a test, a character must know a relevant [skill](#skills) and the one being helped must accept the help. 

Helping in a test works much like [forking](#skill-forking) a skill. The character being helped receives **+1D6** to roll for each *character* helping them. The number of relevant skills a helping character has is irrelevant. Just one is enough to allow them to help and only one **+1D6** is granted by the helping character. Which skill is used to help with, matters, however. 

If a **PC** is helping another, their player must describe *how* they're using their relevant skill to help. 

> For example, a **PC** is currently using their [thievery](#thievery-agi) to lockpick a door. Their allied **PC** is *helping*, by using their [observation](#observation-perc) skill to *keep an eye out for guards*, which allows the one on the door to work without having to constantly look over their shoulder. The **GM** finds that description agreeable and allows the use of the skill to help. 

Ultimately, whether a skill is appropriate to help with is determined by the **GM**. 

#### Helpers Learn
A character helping in a test, also gains [progress](#advancing-skills) towards the [skill](#skills) they've helped with. The outcome of the test for the character they helped, is their own outcome. 

> If the character who was helped succeeded their test, the helper also gains a successful test to mark on their skill. 

### Time
Not all tests are created equal - some actions require more time than others. 

While the **GM** decides on how much time a given test will need, the following guidelines should provide a good basis. 

* (Near) instantaneous: Combat actions, recalling knowledge, noticing things in passing. 
* A matter of minutes: inspecting an environment, quickly skimming the contents of a book, persuading someone in conversation, first aid. 
* A matter of hours: Simple crafts, surgery, scrutinizing an environment, researching something simple/not obscure, engaging in lengthy and difficult negotiations.
* A matter of days and months: Complex crafts and artistry, researching a complex or obscure subject. 

# Character
A character is a representation of a sentient creature in the game world. They're an amalgam of [attributes](#attributes), [skills](#skills), [ambitions, beliefs & instincts](#ambitions-beliefs--instincts) and of course their [possessions](#possessions--equipment). 

## Attributes
**Attributes** describe a character's basic, inherent abilities. 

The value of an attribute indicates the number of **D6** to roll for a test of that attribute. Attribute values typically range from 2 to 6 for ordinary human characters. 

**Attributes** [advance](#advancing-attributes), as they're tested. It is also possible to [practice](#practicing-attributes) **attributes**. It is **not** possible to teach **attributes**, however. 

Unlike [skills](#skills), it is not possible to [fork](#skill-forking) **attributes**. 

### Physical Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic physical abilities. 

#### Agility [Agi]
Determines how nimble, fast and flexible a character is. Any action that requires a character to move very precisely, will require agility. 

#### Endurance [End]
Governs how long a character can endure physical strains. 

For every point in endurance, a character raises their [Exhaustion Threshold](#exhaustion) by two. 

#### Perception [Perc]
Governs a character's ability to passively quickly pick up on fine and fleeting details in their environment or on objects and other characters. 

Also governs the ability to perceive under difficult conditions such as dim light and fog, or noisy and smelly environments. 

#### Strength [Str]
Governs a character's strength - the ability to lift, throw and break heavy and sturdy things. Such as skulls. Also governs the [carrying capacity](#carrying-capacity) of a character. 

Each point in strength raises the [carrying capacity](#carrying-capacity) of the character by 3. 

#### Toughness [Tough]
Governs the [injury threshold](#injury) of a character. 

For every point in [toughness](#toughness-tough), a character gains **+2 maximum HP**. 

For every two points in [toughness](#toughness-tough), a character raises their **Inj.** limit by 1. 

### Mental Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic mental abilities. 

#### Intelligence [Int]
Governs a character's ability to reason and analyze. 

#### Wisdom [Wis]
Governs a character's understanding of and ability to recall knowledge. 

### Social Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic social abilities. 

#### Empathy [Emp]
Governs a character's ability to read and understand another's emotions and intentions. 

#### Oratory [Ora]
Governs a character's ability to convincingly speak with and before others. Also used to manipulate others. 

#### Willpower [Will]
Governs a character's ability to withstand persuasion, intimidation, charm or terror. 

### Arcane Attributes
These numbers represent a character's basic arcane abilities. 

These are the only attributes that can have an associated value of 0, as not all characters have magical ability. If a character doesn't have a value of at least 1 in these attributes, they will be unable to advance them, at all. A non-mage will remain a non-mage. 

#### Arcana [Arc]
Governs a character's ability to control magic flow, thus casting magic spells.

#### Magic Sense [MS]
Governs a character's ability to sense the flow of magic. This allows them to anticipate magical attacks and detect lingering magic. 

### Advancing Attributes
Whenever a **PC** uses an attribute in a [test](#tests), the outcome must be noted. 

Advancing an **attribute** requires:
* (N + 1) * (N + 1) * 3 **complete successess**.
* (N + 1) * (N + 1) * 4 **partial successess** or **complete failures**.
* Where *N* is the current level of the **attribute**. 

> A character has a [strength](#strength-str) **attribute** at level 3. 
> 
> To advance their **attribute** to level 4, they would need (3 + 1) * (3 + 1) * 3 = 48 **complete successes** and (3 + 1) * (3 + 1) * 4 = 64 **partial successess** or **complete failures**

For your convenience, the following table contains the precalculated requirements to advance an **attribute** level. 
* In the table, 'Level' is the character's *current level* in the **attribute**. 
* Note it is possible to go past level 10, but you shouldn't hope for it. 

| Level | Successes | Failures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 12  | 16  |
| 2   | 27  | 36  |
| 3   | 48  | 64  |
| 4   | 75  | 100 |
| 5   | 108 | 144 |
| 6   | 147 | 196 |
| 7   | 192 | 256 |
| 8   | 243 | 324 |
| 9   | 300 | 400 |
| 10  | 363 | 484 |

#### Practicing Attributes
It is possible to advance attributes *passively*. Whenever a large period of time is spent outside of active adventure, **PC**'s can practice an attribute of choice. 

A **PC** can only actively practice one **attribute**. Furthermore, a **PC** can not both be actively practicing an **attribute** *and* a **skill**. They must choose - either practice an **attribute** *or* a **skill**. 

For every **cycle** that passes of active practice, the **PC** can roll a [test](#tests) for the chosen **attribute**. 

A **cycle** is 2 Months, regardless of attribute being practiced. 

> A **PC** spends a year practicing their [arcana](#arcana-arc), while the **GM** prepares the next story arc. In this case, 5 tests can be made and their outcomes noted. 

## Skills
A **skill** is any acquired knowledge and experience regarding a specific subject. 

All of a character's **skills** have a value attached to them, which indicates the number of **D6** to use when testing that **skill**. Skill values typically range from 1 to 3 for most skills. 4 and 5 is very good, 6 is excellence and 7 and above is mastery. 

When [testing a skill](#tests), add half of the related [attribute](#attributes)'s value (rounded down) as number of additional dice for the test. 

**Skills** [advance](#advancing-skills), as they're tested. It is also possible to [practice](#practice) and [teach](#teaching) **skills**. 

It is also possible to [fork](#skill-forking) **skills**, granting more dice to roll in a test. 

### Skill Forking
For every **skill** a character knows (= is not currently still learning), and they are currently testing a **skill** that is thematically related, they can **fork** that **skill** into their test, granting them **+1D6** for their test. 

> Imagine a large forked rivermouth. One of the forks feeding into it is also a large river, which represents the **skill** primarily being tested. The other, smaller forks of the river represent the supporting **skills**. They all combine together at the rivermouth. A primary and supporting **skills** flow together into the test! 

> For example, if a character is testing their [thievery](#thievery-dex--perc--spd) **skill** at level three and they also know [stealth](#stealth-dex--spd--int), they can **fork** their stealth **skill** into their thievery test. Any number of **skills** can be **forked** into a test, but each **fork** only grants **+1D6**. For the thievery test above, it doesn't matter if the character is at stealth level one or five or nine-thousand. They only get a **+1D6** to their thievery test. So in this case, if the **GM** agrees, the player gets to roll **4D6** for their test. 

Which **skills** can be **forked** into a particular test is up to the **GM**. If a player is performing a test, they can lobby for the use of the **skills** they want to **fork** into their particular test, but ultimately, if the **GM** says no, that decision is final. 

> Back to the thievery example. Let's assume a **PC** is trying to quickly unlock a door using their [thievery](#thievery-dex--perc--spd), because they're being chased by guards and desperately need to get away. They could argue to fork their [stealth](#stealth-dex--spd--int) **skill** into the test, but ultimately, what use is stealth when you've already been detected? Unless you can make yourself *unseen* somehow, the **GM** should rule that stealth cannot apply in that situation. 

### Intent & Action
The players drive the story and the action. When deciding on what to do, make sure you state the **intent** of your action, like "I will make that person work for us!". 

Then, the **GM** will need to know how you aim to follow up on your intent. Describe the **action** you will take. The clearer, the better. "I will tell them of our exploits and how well we get paid!", is a good response and allows the **GM** to conclude you're trying to [persuade](#persuasion-emp) the other character. Even better would be something like "I will *persuade* them by telling them of our exploits and how well we get paid!" That leaves no room for doubt *how* you wish to achieve your goal. 

Of course, how appropriate a certain **skill** is for the resolution of a given situation, is ultimately up to the **GM** and the specifics of the situation itself. 

### Learning Skills
Whenever asked to test a skill a **PC** does not yet know, it will be added or progressed in the *currently learning* section of the character sheet. 

A skill in learning can only be tested with their related [attribute](#attributes). If multiple attributes are listed for a skill, you can choose which one to test with. 

A skill in learning must be tested at **double the** **Ob** than if it were a known skill. 

> A player is asked to test their character's [Leatherworking](#leatherworking-agi) at **Ob** 2. Their character lacks that skill and thus adds it to the *currently learning* section on their character sheet. Assuming their character has an agility of 3, they get to roll **3D6**. But since this is a skill being learned, the **Ob** must be doubled. 
> 
> The player cannot, mathematically, succeed a test at **Ob 4** with just **3D6**. Their character fails, but at least they learned a little from the attempt, which is noted on the skill in the *currently learning* section. 

The outcome of a test gets noted on the skill it was made for, not the attribute actually used for the test. 

**Forking** learning skills is not allowed. **Forking** into learning skills isn't allowed, either. 

### Advancing Skills
Whenever a **PC** uses a **skill** in a [test](#tests), the outcome must be noted. 

Advancing a **skill** requires:
* (N + 1) * N * 2 **complete successess**.
* (N + 1) * N * 3 **partial successess** or **complete failures**.
* Where *N* is the current level of the attribute. 

> A character has a [nature](#nature-int) **skill** at level 2. 
> 
> To advance their **skill** to level 3, they would need (3 + 1) * 3 * 2 = 24 **complete successes** and (3 + 1) * 3 * 3 = 36 **partial successess** or **complete failures**

For your convenience, the following table contains the precalculated requirements to advance a **skill** level. 
* In the table, 'Level' is the character's *current level* in the **skill**. 
* Note it is possible to go past level 10, but you shouldn't hope for it. 
* Note that level 0 requirements do not follow the formula above, instead being 10/14 (S/F). 

| Level | Successes | Failures |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0   | 10  | 14  |
| 1   | 4   | 6   |
| 2   | 12  | 18  |
| 3   | 24  | 36  |
| 4   | 40  | 60  |
| 5   | 60  | 90  |
| 6   | 84  | 126 |
| 7   | 112 | 168 |
| 8   | 144 | 216 |
| 9   | 180 | 270 |
| 10  | 220 | 330 |

#### Practice
It is possible to advance skills *passively*. Whenever a large period of time is spent outside of active adventure, **PC**'s can practice a skill of choice. 

A **PC** can only actively practice one **category of skills**. For every **cycle** that passes of active practice, the **PC** can roll a [test](#tests) of a skill of the corresponding category. Furthermore, a **PC** can not both be actively practicing a **skill** *and* an **attribute**. They must choose - either practice a **skill** *or* an **attribute**. 

| Skill Category | Cycle    |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Physical       | 3 Weeks  |
| Social         | 2 Weeks  |
| Craftsmanship  | 1 Month  |
| Knowledge      | 2 Months |

> A **PC** spends seven weeks practicing their [fighting](#fighting-str), while waiting for their comrade to recover from their [injuries](#injury). [Fighting](#fighting-str) being a physical skill, the cycle for tests is 3 weeks. In this case, 2 tests can be made and their outcomes noted. 

#### Teaching
Much like it is possible for a character to [practice](#practice) on their own, they can also be taught by another, who knows more than them. 

Both teacher and pupil must actively spend time together, furthering the pupil's skill. The rules for cycle and test are the same as with [practice](#practice). The cycles noted in the table below are used instead. 

| Skill Category | Cycle    |
| -------------- | -------- |
| Physical       | 2 Weeks  |
| Social         | 1 Week   |
| Craftsmanship  | 3 Weeks  |
| Knowledge      | 1 Month  |

If the teacher's skill is at least one level higher than that of their student, the student can use an extra **+1D6** to resolve their tests of the skill they're being taught. 

## Ambitions, Beliefs & Instincts
While all characters are expected to have *ambitions*, *beliefs* and *instincts*, **PC**s are special, because for them, these concepts are cemented through rules and mechanics. 

**Ambitions**, **beliefs** and **instincts** can not change during a game session. They can only be changed in-between. 

Whenever a player plays to their **ambitions**, **beliefs** and **instincts** in certain ways, they earn [fate points](#fate-points). 

It is the **GM**'s role, to create interesting situations, which can *challenge* the **beliefs** and **instincts**, or even **ambitions** of the **PC**s. However the players and **PC**s react, can earn them [fate points](#fate-points) and will drive the story forward. 

### Ambition
Every **PC** must have one **ambition** - a life-fulfilling long-term goal to pursue. This can be anything from "found a family" to "become king of the world!". No matter how unrealistic, an **ambition** is a primary driver for a character, to guide them onward. The important part is to think *big*. Something easily achievable would make for a dull **ambition** and defeat the point of it. 

An **ambition** is not expected to change often. An ideal **ambition** would accompany a character a long time. 

### Beliefs
A player also has to decide on three **beliefs** for their character, which represent short-term goals and expectations of the character and their player. A belief should not be a triviality, but instead a goal that requires some considerable effort on both the character's and player's part to achieve. 

A belief must be based on the events and circumstances affecting the character in game. 

> For example, a **PC** learns of a conspiracy against their lord during the session. After the session, they decide they'll change one of their **beliefs** to "I will uncover the plot against my lord!"

**Beliefs** can also target other **PC**s. You can either set a belief to help or even change your fellow **PC**. Be mindful though, your belief should not be *too* drastic.

> For example, a **PC** learns their ally is a member of a secretive and dangerous cult. After the session, the player determines the new belief "I will get my ally to leave that dangerous cult!" Whether successful or not, this belief, in play, will create an **interesting conflict** between the two **PC**s. 

**Beliefs** are expected to change frequently, commonly from session to session. But not so frequent as to make achieving them impossible. 

### Instincts
Much like [beliefs](#beliefs), a player must determine three **instincts** for their character. 

An **instinct** represents an automatic reaction from the character, given a situation that triggers it. They can be seen as "if/then" and "always/never" statements. These can either be beneficial or detrimental to the character. 
* A detrimental **instinct** acts as a *troublemaker* and allows earning [fate points](#fate-points). 
* A beneficial **instinct** acts as *insurance*, but doesn't allow earning [fate points](#fate-points). 

> For example: "Whenever someone praises the state religion, I start ranting against it." - This is a detrimental **instinct**, as the **GM** can use that to cause the **PC** trouble. 

> Another example: "Whenever a lethal fight breaks out, I have my weapons in hand!" - This is insurance, that even when the **PC** narratively might not have their weapons at the ready, they will, in fact, have them at the ready. 

Ideally, an **instinct** should be (ab-)usable by the **GM**, to get the **PC** into *trouble* easier. This is to be taken with a wink, though. A **GM** is expected to craft an *interesting* story and thus create *interesting* conundrums for the players and their characters, with a realistic chance for the players and their characters to maneuver themselves back out of trouble. 

**Instincts** are expected to change whenever a character (decides) to act against them. A **PC** cannot keep an instinct they keep contradicting. 

## Health & Exhaustion
Every character has **Hit Points (HP)** and a maximum number of **Injuries (Inj.)** they can endure, before they die. 

Whenever a character is hurt, the **damage** that has been inflicted upon them is deducted from their **HP**. When their **HP** reach zero, they suffer an **Inj.** and their **HP** is reset to their **maximum - N\*2**, where *N* is the number of **Inj.** they currently have. So, in other words, for every **Inj.**, a character loses 2 maximum **HP**. Any **HP** past zero overflow, so the damage dealt isn't lost. 

When [Toughness](#toughness-tough) is reduced, still only 2 maximum **HP** are deducted. 

Outside of combat, a successful [medicine](#medicine-int) test can restore all currently missing **HP** of a character. 

### Injury
An **injury (Inj.)** is a serious health impediment of a character. Every character has a maximum number of **Inj.** they can endure. If they reach their maximum number of **Inj.**, the character dies. **PC**s are an exception, who instead arrive at [death's door](#deaths-door). 

Whenever a character suffers an **Inj.**, a **D100** must be rolled and the corresponding result from the [list of injuries](#list-of-injuries) added to the character. 

Whenever a character is brought to at least half their maximum number of **Inj.** (rounded down), they must succeed a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test, or else suffer +1 [exhaustion](#exhaustion). 

An **Inj.** can reduce [attributes](#attributes) and impose other restrictions. An [attribute](#attributes) cannot be brought down to less than 1, by **Inj.**

There are three possible states of an **Inj.**: **active**, **patched up** or **treated**

Only an **active** **Inj.** imposes negative effects. 

An **Inj.** can be **patched up** via [medicine](#medicine-int):
* If the attempt is a complete success, the **Inj.** is **patched up**.
* If the attempt is a partial success or a complete failure, the **Inj.** remains **active**. 

An **Inj.** can be properly **treated** via [surgery](#surgery-int): 
* If the attempt is a complete success, the **Inj.** is **treated**. 
* If the attempt is a partial success, the **Inj.** is not **treated**, but another attempt can be made. 
* If the attempt at is a complete failure, the **Inj.** becomes permanent. It cannot be **treated** via [surgery](#surgery-int) anymore. 
* Only one [surgery](#surgery-int) attempt can be made every 24 hours. 

All currently **treated** **Inj.** can be removed/recovered from, by spending **ND4** weeks in uninterrupted, active recovery, where *N* is the current number of **treated** **Inj.** Active recovery implies spending the vast majority of the day in bed or at least avoiding physical or mental strains. 

### Exhaustion
Exhaustion is the measure of a character's maximum physical and mental strain they can endure. 

If a character's exhaustion reaches their threshold, they become [dazed](#dazed) from over-exertion. 

Exhaustion is gained through performing **exhausting actions**, carrying **exhausting equipment** or suffering [injuries](#injury). **Exhausting actions** are any actions that are physically or mentally taxing, such as:
* Attacking
* Acrobatics (jumping, climbing)
* [Casting Magic](#casting-magic)

Exhaustion gained from **exhausting actions** can be reduced by resting. A full rest of at least six uninterrupted hours will fully clear any exhaustion gained from **exhausting actions**. 

Exhaustion gained from **exhausting equipment**, can be reduced, by dropping the equipment in question and resting for a short while, at the **GM**'s discretion. A character trying to carry more than they can endure, should not immediately fall unconscious, mind you. Apply common sense - the character in question would probably try to carry the extra equipment, only find out right away it is simply too much for them. 

### Status Effects
Characters can have one or more **status effect(s)** affecting them. A **status effect** can have positive or negative effects on the character. 

#### Dazed
A **dazed** character begins their turn with -2 **AP** and can run at most only half the distance they normally could. In addition, they suffer a penalty of **-1D** to all tests. The number of dice for a test cannot be reduced to less than 1 by this penalty. 

#### Unconscious
An **unconscious** character is unable to act and is unaware of their surroundings. 

Someone *knocked* **unconscious** can't awaken due to external stimuli and have to recover, first. For how long, depends on the circumstances. But several hours hould be a good baseline. 

#### Grappled
A **grappled** character is unable to move and suffers -1 [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi), for as long as they are **grappled**. A **grappled** character can break free, by **completely succeeding** a [strength](#strength-str) test against the other character grappling them. 

#### Death's Door
**Death's door** is a state only a **PC** can enter and represents their final battle with death. 

A **PC** at **death's door** must succeed at least one [toughness](#toughness-tough) test out of a possible of three. If they never succeed, they perish, irrevocably. 
* If the character is at **death's door** during [combat](#combat), they must make a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test at the end of every round. 
* If the character is at **death's door** out of [combat](#combat), they must make a test every minute. 

A character can be helped out of **death's door**, if all of their **active** **Inj.** are **patched up** or **treated**. For every **active** **Inj.** that is **patched up** or **treated**, the character gains one more attempt to succeed a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test. 

### Illness
An illness can affect a character over a perod of time and cause various negative effects. 

Illness can be contracted in a variety of ways, although most of them involve an open wound exposed to bacterial breeding grounds, such as bogs, sewers, mass graves and trash dumps. Or from something ingested, such as spoiled or poisoned food. 

When a character is about to contract an illness, they most make a [toughness](#toughness-tough) test:
* On a **complete success**, the illness is shrugged off. 
* On a **partial success** or **complete failure**, the illness is contracted and will immediately apply its effects to the character. 
* If they contracted the illness, determine which one by rolling a **D100** and picking the corresponding illness from the [list of illnesses](#list-of-illnesses). 
  * Once the illness has been determined, its duration and severity must also be rolled. 

Most illnesses have a duration, during which their effects are active and after which, all ill-effects go away. In some cases, an illness may have a duration of "until cured", which means it will never go away, if not treated. 

Treatment of an illness is possible through [medicine](#medicine-int) or [surgery](#surgery-int). Which skill is required, will be noted on the illness. Treatment will often be able to reduce the ill-effects and sometimes to remove the illness, altogether. A treatment attempt can only be made once every 24 hours. 

Any illness, that when treated has its duration reduced, can only have its duration reduced once. If a treatment would also suspend any ill-effects, that would still be applicable. That way, treating an illness which already had its duration reduced can still be useful. 

### Damage Types
All damage inflicted, is inflicted with a certain type of damage. 

| Damage Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Slashing    | Usually inflicted by any sort of cutting/slashing weapon, like a sword, or a talon. |
| Piercing    | Usually inflicted by any sort of stabbing weapon, like a spear, or an animal's stinger. |
| Bludgeoning | Inflicted by light blunt weapons and unarmed attacks. **Bludgeoning** causes non-lethal damage. It inflicts [exhaustion](#exhaustion) instead of [injuries](#injury). A [dazed](#dazed) character hit with **bludgeoning** damage has to succeed an [endurance](#endurance-end) test, or else fall [unconscious](#unconscious). |
| Crushing    | Usually inflicted by any sort of heavy blunt weapon, like a hammer, or an animal's tusks. |
| Burning     | Inflicted by extreme heat. |
| Freezing    | Inflicted by extreme cold. |
| Poison      | Usually represents a [damage over time effect](#damage-over-time).. |
| Acid        | Dissolves anything it touches, or perhaps just organic matter. |

### Damage Over Time
Also known as *damage over time* or *status effect*, these are [damage types](#damage-types), which inflict injuries over a set period of time. 

Every **damage over time** has an **intensity level**. The intensity governs how many injuries a afflicted character/creature suffers and at which intervals. 

| Damage Type | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Bleeding    | One point of **damage** per intensity level, per round of **combat**, or every minute. |
| Poisoned    | One point of **damage** per intensity level, per round of **combat**, or every minute. |

### Damage Resistances
Some creatures can resist certain [types of damage](#damage-types) naturally, while others may cover themselves in armor to the same effect. 

How much **damage** is resisted, depends on the specifics of the creature or character and their [equipment](#possessions--equipment). 

## Possessions & Equipment
A character may have things on their persion, such as worn equipment, as well as the things they *own*. 

### Money
Money is generalized as **crowns**, with no regard for regional currencies. The following table gives a brief overview of the value of **crowns**. 

Keep in mind most of the really expensive things are usually paid for not in **crowns**, but rather in favors, fealty or rare items. 

| Cost Range | Goods                      | Services                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1-10       | Unprocessed foods; Very common things | Simple Lodgings; Sending a message a short distance with a messenger; Peasant's and hireling pay |
| 10-50      | Low to medium quality alcoholic drinks; A proper, warm meal; Simple tools and items; Simple weapons, like a dagger or woodcutter's axe; Plain clothes or cloth; Farm animals; Somewhat common things | Lodgings in a private room; Private services; Simple equipment repairs; Travel by carriage or stagecoach; A simple guard's pay |
| 50-100     | Light armor; Decorated clothes; Weapons; Shields; Fine drinks; Lordly meals; Decorative silver things; Low-quality gems; Horses; Books and Scriptures; Uncommon things | Medical services; An elite guard's pay |
| 100-500    | Medium to heavy armor; Well-made weapons; Decorative gold things; High-quality gems; Carefully bred war-steeds; Small building in a large city; Rare things |  |
| 500-1000   | Decorated armor; Decorated well-made weapons; Large building in a large city; [Magic runes](#runes); Very rare things |  |

### Carrying Capacity
Characters have **item slots** that determine how much they can carry. How many **item slots** they have, is determined by their [strength](#strength-str). The number of **item slots** a character has is referred to as the **carrying capacity**. 

Most things will take up one **slot**, which equals something around 5lb/2kg, but some particularly large and/or heavy items can take up more **slots**. How many **slots** an item takes up, is referred to as **bulk**. 

> An item with **bulk** 2 takes up 2 **item slots**. 

So, while most items, such as tools, a day's rations, or books have only 1 **bulk**, armor and weapons typically have more. 

Up to 100 [crowns](#money) can fit into one **slot**. 

> A **PC** has 56 **crowns**, those all go into 1 **slot**. Their ally is significantly wealthier, with 314 **crowns**, which take up 4 **item slots**.

It is up to the **GM** to decide on when something is *too heavy* to carry for the character in question. 

## Character Creation
Imagine for the longest time of their life, your character has led an ordinary existence, until one day, something life-changing happened. Perhaps something terrible, perhaps something wonderful, but something significant that has forced them out of their comfort zone into a world full of adventure. 

Creating an interesting and life-like character is a challenging, but ultimately, very rewarding task. Thinking of their existence up to the point they start adventuring, can really help with paving the path of their future and give you a good idea of what they're like, and why.

If you don't feel inspired, the following sections can provide tips and randomization tables that allow you write up a character more quickly. 

The procedure of creating a character consists of the following steps:
1. [Determine life path](#determine-life-path). 
2. [Determine name & personality](#determine-name--personality).
3. [Determine species, sex & appearance](#species-sex--appearance).
4. [Determine **ambition**, **beliefs** & **instincts**](#choosing-ambition-beliefs--instincts). 
5. [Determine **attributes**](#choosing-attributes).
6. [Determine **skills**](#choosing-skills).
7. [Determine **carrying capacity** and **possessions**](#carrying-capactity--possessions).
8. [Determine **Max HP** and **Max Inj.**](#determine-max-hp--max-inj)
9. [Determine exhaustion threshold](#determine-exhaustion-threshold).

### Determine Life Path
Where and when does the story of your character begin? Under what circumstances are they born and how were they raised? Until adulthood, did they lead a life of carelessness or did they have to fight for every scrap of food? How did they lead their life up until the point the picked up adventuring? 

Answering these questions will help you figure out what your character could be like, as a person and what kinds of **ambitions**, **beliefs** and **instincts** they might develop. 

If you need inspiration, the following tables might help a spark along:
#### Origin
| Range D6 | Origin | 
| -------- | ------ |
| 1 | You were born into the life of a noble. |
| 2 | You were born as the only child of a merchant. |
| 3 | You were found as an orphaned infant and grew up in the hands of a kind foster family. |
| 4 | You were found as an abandoned infant at the doors to an orphanage. |
| 5 | You were born as the fifth child of a farmer. |
| 6 | You were born to a craftsman. |

#### Youth
| Range D10 | Youth | 
| --------- | --------- |
| 1 | You developed a passion for a craft and found a master willing to teach you his art. |
| 2 | You never quite found your place in the world and never found a passion for honest work. Instead, you took to a life of lowly crime, pickpocketing and extorting what you could. |
| 3 | You spent much time with books and scrolls, reading about the world and its wonders. |
| 4 | You were drafted into the military and remained in service for a few years. |
| 5 | You went where the wind took you, doing lowly hireling pay when necessary and otherwise exploring and enjoying life as it came. |
| 6 | You preferred life in the wilderniss and either took to the hermit's life or simply camped out in the woods as much as possible. |
| 7 | You were wrongfully imprisoned for a crime you didn't commit. Or, perhaps, you did? |
| 8 | You, by chance, met a mage, who sensed your lust for power. They taught you their knowledge, in secret, whenever you were available. |
| 9 | You found yourself wanting to better the world. You helped others where possible and eventually picked up on the healing arts, perhaps even learning under a tutor. |
| 10 | You were taught by a wealthy and successful merchant (perhaps your parent) and helped with running their business for a few years. |

#### The Last Few Years
| Range D6 | The Last Few Years | 
| -------- | --------- |
| 1 | You made an enemy you couldn't beat and were thus forced to leave town. Since then, you've been on the run. |
| 2 | You've been given an important task to carry out in secret. A piece of parchment holds your orders, but the task is simply too great for you to complete on your own. |
| 3 | You've found yourself with an insatiable curiosity and decided to go see the world and its wonders. |
| 4 | You decided to go on a pilgrimage, but were distracted from your path. |
| 5 | You swore an oath and intend to keep it. You swore to rescue someone, or bring honor to your clan, or perhaps to bring justice to a known criminal. |
| 6 | You lost someone or something you held dear. Now, you're on a quest to get it back, or your revenge. |

### Determine Name & Personality
Any interesting character should have an interesting name. Whether you set a name or personality first, is entirely up to you. Although, you might prefer to delay this step until much later, once you've determined the other aspects of your character. Whichever you find easier is fine. 

If you can't come up with a name, you can ask your **GM** for inspiration, since they'll likely know the world and the culture(s) your character can stem from and what kinds of names are common there. 

Perhaps more important than the name, is the personality that it represents. Think about what you want your character to be like - are they very sociable? Or perhaps a taciturn brute who'd rather let their actions speak? What ideals do they have? A virtue and perhaps a vice? How do they speak? Do they stutter? 

| Range D10 | Virtue      | Vice       | Speech     |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| 1         | Courageous  | Cowardly   | Blunt      |
| 2         | Courteous   | Cruel      | Boisterous |
| 3         | Disciplined | Greedy     | Formal     |
| 4         | Honest      | Irascible  | Gravelly   |
| 5         | Honorable   | Prejudiced | Mumbling   |
| 6         | Humble      | Reckless   | Precise    |
| 7         | Righteous   | Wasteful   | Rambling   |
| 8         | Loyal       | Vengeful   | Dialect    |
| 9         | Just        | Arrogant   | Stuttering |
| 10        | Merciful    | Vain       | Rapid-fire |

### Species, Sex & Appearance
Species is a bit difficult to provide a randomization table for, because the world your **GM** is running, might have different species available, than could be anticipated here. For simplicity's sake, it is assumed you are generating a human here. 

Gender is personal preference, but could also be decided by a coin flip. 

| Range D10 | Physique    | Face       | Skin       | Hair     |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| 1         | Athletic    | Bloated    | Scar       | Bald     |
| 2         | Brawny      | Blunt      | Birthmark  | Braided  |
| 3         | Corpulent   | Bony       | Makeup     | Curly    |
| 4         | Delicate    | Chiseled   | Tattooed   | Cropped  |
| 5         | Gaunt       | Delicate   | Weathered  | Frizzy   |
| 6         | Hulking     | Elongated  | Perfect    | Long     |
| 7         | Lanky       | Patrician  | Tanned     | Ponytail |
| 8         | Stout       | Pinched    | War Paint  | Oily     |
| 9         | Short       | Narrow     | Pale       | Wavy     |
| 10        | Scrawny     | Broken     | Pierced    | Greased  |

### Choosing Ambition, Beliefs & Instincts
As described in the [section with the same name](#ambitions-beliefs--instincts), what your character believes in and what drives them onward, is key in playing them. Don't worry too much about your first **beliefs** and **instincts**, they're expected to change frequently, anyway. 

Only your **ambition** will require some thought beforehand, but even so, you don't have to plan your character's future, at all. That is the **GM**'s job, after all. But keep in mind your character's **ambition** tells your **GM**, what kind of stories you'd like to explore and what's more, how your character will fit into them. 

#### Choosing an Ambition
At the core of every character stands their [ambition](#ambition), which is the primary force driving them. A good **ambition** should last you a long time and give the **GM** a hint what kind of story you want to explore with your character. 

Talk to your **GM** about the **ambition** you want your character to have. On the one hand, it allows them to determine the kind of story you want to explore and on the other hand they can guage whether the **ambition** is a suitable long-term goal. 

Keep in mind the **ambition** you can randomly determine here is kept most basic and generic. Work with your **GM** to fill in the details. 

| Range D10 | Ambition           | 
| --------- | ------------------ | 
| 1         | Revenge            | 
| 2         | Pilgrimage         | 
| 3         | Wealth             | 
| 4         | Power              | 
| 5         | Fame/Glory         | 
| 6         | Knowledge          | 
| 7         | Family & Belonging | 
| 8         | Atonement          | 
| 9         | World Betterment   | 
| 10        | Fire               | 

#### Choosing Beliefs
Now, the time to determine your three [beliefs](#beliefs) has come. Yet again, your **GM** is integral in finding them. However, the other **PC**s are also of interest now. You can have **beliefs** whose subject is one of the other **PC**s. You could have the game begin with two or more of the **PC**s knowing each other. 

A good **belief** has a *subject* and a well-defined *goal*. It doesn't necessarily matter if the goal is attainable, though. Unlike an **ambition**, a **belief** doesn't have to be long-term, at all. If it comes up during play, you could achieve your **belief** within the first session. On the other hand, some **beliefs** never come to fruition. 

> Two **PC**s begin the game knowing each other. One starts with a background as a criminal, the other as a former monk. The former monk has a **belief** stating "Stealing isn't right! I will help my friend pick up honest work!" The thief, on the other hand has the **belief** "My friend has my back, but they really need to start looking after themselves! I will teach them to be more like me." 
> 
> These two **beliefs** allow these characters to come into conflict, despite their good intentions. How it will play out, no one can say. And that makes for an interesting conflict!

#### Choosing Instincts
Lastly, you need three [instincts](#instincts) for your character. Ideally, at least one of them should allow your **GM** getting your **PC** into *trouble*. 

### Choosing Attributes
There are two methods for determining your character's attributes: manual and semi-random. 

Please keep in mind the values here are for a human. Other species may have modifiers on their attributes, making them better or worse in some of them. But that depends on the world your **GM** is running. 

#### Manual Attribute Assignment
* You can spend 20 points on your attributes. 
* All attributes start at level 2. 
* No attribute may have a level less than 2 nor higher than 6.
* Only two attributes may have a level of 6. 

> Player *A.* chooses manual attribute assignment - they know what kind of character they'd like to build. 
> 
> They pick two attributes they want to focus on. Let's say they picked **strength** and **toughness** - a good choice for a front-line fighter and ardent protector. 
>
> This means they already spent 8 points and have 12 left. 
>
> They put some emphasis on **endurance** - also good for a fighter - and place it at level 4. They have 10 points left. 
> 
> They level up **oratory** and **will** - they plan on intimidating foes, while being unyielding, themselves. Those attributes are at level 5, each. Thus, there are 4 points left. 
>
> The last 4 points are then spread out across **agility**, **perception**, **intelligence** and **empathy**, which are each now at level 3. 
>
> Thus, **arcana** and **wisdom** are left at level 2, with no more points left over to raise these attributes. 

#### Semi-Random Attribute Assignment
1. Roll 11 **D6**
2. Row up your dice to form a line, then read them from one end to the other and note each value. The order in which they are written down, is the order in which they'll be applied to the attributes. 
3. If there are more than 2 6s, start lowering their value by one, starting from the left or the right, until there are only 2 6s left. 
4. Count up the total of your values and subtract that from 42. 
   
   a) If the number is negative, that's the number of levels you'll have to go down. 
   
   b) If the number is positive, that's the number of levels you'll have to go up. 

5. Starting from the left or right, start adjusting each value, until your attribute level total is at 42. 
  
  a) If your levels have to go down, subtract one from each value. **But** don't adjust 6s, 2s or 1s. 
  
  b) If your levels have to go up, add one to each value. **But** don't adjust 6s. If there are less than 2 6s, a 5 may be raised to a 6, otherwise, don't adjust 5s. 

6. Lastly, any remaining 1s have to be turned into 2s, then repeat from step 4. 

> Player *B.* prefers the semi-random assignment method. Thus, they roll 11 **D6** with the following results: 1, 6, 4, 5, 5, 4, 5, 3, 6, 3, 6
>
> They lower their right-most 6, so they have only 2 6s: 1, 6, 4, 5, 5, 4, 5, 3, 6, 3, 5
> 
> Their level total is currently 47 and their difference is -5. That means five values will need to be lowered. 
>
> Starting from the left, they start lowering the values, one by one: 1, 6, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 6, 3, 5
> 
> Now, the 1 must be turned into a 2: 2, 6, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 6, 3, 5
> 
> The new total would now be 43, which is one point too many. One value must be lowered to compensate. Player *B.* decides to start from the right, this time, arriving at the final values: 2: 2, 6, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 6, 3, 4
> 
> Thus, their final attribute levels are: 2 **agility**, 6 **endurance**, 3 **perception**, 4 **strength**, 4 **toughness**, 3 **arcana**, 4 **intelligence**, 3 **wisdom**, 6 **empathy**, 3 **oratory** and 4 **will**.
> 
> Perhaps this could be a very socially orientated character? With an **empathy** of 6, they'd make for a skilled diplomat, shrewd negotiator and attentive inquisitor. On the other hand, with an **endurance** of 6 and **arcana** of 3, they could become a very enduring mage. Perhaps that could be decided by a dice roll, too..?

#### Determine Attribute Advancing Thresholds
Once attribute values have been set, you can determine the required number of successes and failures each attribute requires, in order to advance. 

For this, see the rules on [attribute advancing](#advancing-attributes).

### Choosing Skills
You can spend **8** points to *learn* skills and raise their level, with the following limitations:
* No skill can be at level 4 or higher.
* You can have at most 5 skills. 
* No skills can be set to *learning*.
* Skills should relate to your character's life path. 

Once you've chosen skills, you can determine the required number of successes and failures each skill requires, in order to advance. 

For this, see the rules on [skill advancing](#advancing-skills).

### Carrying Capactity & Possessions
First, determine your character's maximum [carrying capacity](#carrying-capacity). Refer to the [strength](#strength-str) attribute to do so. 

You can add things your character starts the game with. It is best to start with weapon(s), armor, shield and necessities, like food rations and torches. 

However, there some limitations:
* Max 20 **bulk** total.
* Only one armor.
* Only one weapon of **bulk** 3+ OR two weapons of **bulk** 1 or **bulk** 2.
* Only one shield.

### Determine Max HP & Max Inj
Determine your character's **max HP** and **injury limit**, by referring to the [toughness](#toughness-tough) attribute. 

All characters start with an **injury limit** of 1. 

### Determine Exhaustion Threshold
Determine your character's [exhaustion threshold](#exhaustion), by referring to the [endurance](#endurance-end) attribute. 

# Fate Points
Fate points (**FP**) represent a meta-currency that *players* can earn and use to buy boons for their character or the group as a whole. 

There are three types of **FP**: [Minor](#minor-fate-points), [major](#major-fate-points) and [ambition](#ambition-fate-points). 

**FP** are earned, by playing to one's [ambitions, beliefs and instincts](#ambitions-beliefs--instincts). Most **FP** are earned by a single player, but some may also be earned as a group. 

## Minor Fate Points
**Minor Fate Points (MiFP)** are the lowest valued and most common type of **FP**, most commonly earned by playing the mechanics of the game. 

**MiFP** can be earned in the following ways: 
* **Beliefs**: Playing to one's **beliefs**. This only counts *working towards* a goal set by a belief. 
* **Trouble**: Playing to one's **instincts** - if they get their character, or their allies, into trouble. 
* **Humor**: Stopping the table with a good bit of humor at the right time. But don't overdo it - your **GM** can only weave you a dramatic and gripping story, if you let them. 
* **Specialist**: Driving the story forward, when no one else could - having the right skill to employ at the right time. 
* **Helper**: Helping an ally out at a critical time - during or out of [combat](#combat). 

## Major Fate Points
**Major Fate Points (MaFP)** take more effort from the *player* to earn, only being earned through convincing roleplaying, creative efforts and accomplishing long-term goals. 

**MaFP** can be earned in the following ways: 
* **Beliefs**: Accomplishing a goal set by a belief. 
* **Achievements**: Whenever a major plot point or story arc is concluded - a great journey, uncovering a plot of assassination, fulfilling a contract to clear out a bandit camp or discovering an ancient artifact, all count as *achievements*, which earn this award **for all the players, as a group**. 
* **Embodiment**: Capturing their character and personifying them, in the moment. For example, by giving a great speech, acting scared or enjoying a bitter revenge with glee, as if they were actually there and doing it! 
* **Inner Turmoil**: Convincingly acting out an inner conflict that may come up when a decision that conflicts with a **belief** comes up. If the others can *feel* the gut-wrenching decision being made, this award is earned!
* **Creative Solutions**: Coming up with a very creative way to solve a problem. This may be a diplomatic solution, where the **GM** thought one impossible. Or, perhaps an unexpected use of the environment during **combat**, which earned the **PC**s a distinct advantage on the battlefield, in a way the **GM** couldn't foresee. 
* **Collaboration**: Working with the **GM** to further the world and the story in creative ways and helping the **GM** out when possible. Secret plots that only one of the players is involved in, which causes gasps and applause from the other players, when the plot is finally revealed, for example. 
* **The Gears**: Being *the gears*, without which nothing would move. Doing the laborious work during session, nobody wants to do, but which has to happen to keep the story moving. Always making sure to pitch the tents in the right spot, watching out for traps or doing the boring question-asking all earn this award!

## Ambition Fate Points
**Ambition Fate Points (AFP)** are very rare and only earned through outstanding achievements. 

**AFP** can be earned in the following ways: 
* **World-Shaper**: Changing the world around oneself in a significant way. 
* **Selfless**: Going above and beyond to achieve something, a betterment, not for oneself, but for others and at great cost. 

## Hand of Fate
The **Hand of Fate** is a deck of cards a player can draw from, using their **FP** as currency to buy cards. 

A player can play any of their cards whenever appropriate. A played card is discarded. 

There are no limits to how many of a given card a player can own, but they may only hoard a maximum of 5 cards at a time. 

| Cost    | Name               | Effect             |
| ------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| 3 MiFP  | Single Re-Roll     | Re-Roll a single **negative** die. |
| 6 MiFP  | Clotter            | One **active Inj.** of choice is now **patched up**. |
| 1 MaFP  | Fact Check         | Change a minor plot point in a way your prefer. Work with your **GM** to make sure it fits the narrative, but they should respect your wish. This could be something like avoiding an **NPC** death or changing a fact about the plot. |
| 1 MaFP  | Just a Flesh Wound | Remove or avoid one non-permanent **Inj.** of choice. |
| 1 MaFP  | Hastened           | Gain +1 **AP** during your turn when in [combat](#combat). |
| 5 MaFP  | Double the Fun     | Double the number of dice to roll on your next/current test. |
| 10 MaFP | Wrong Diagnosis    | Remove or avoid one permanent **Inj.** of choice. |
| 1 AFP   | Defy Death         | Leap from [death's door](#deaths-door), remove 1 **active Inj.** of choice and be at 1 **HP**; Alternatively, avoid a narratively-driven death. The **GM** will decide the character's alternative fate. They could be captured, very badly injured or become indebted to someone or something. |
| 1 AFP   | Yes, my liege      | Work with your **GM** to create a follower/hireling who will now be at your command/employ. |

# Combat
When diplomacy fails, hostilities ensue. 

## Who Acts When
At the beginning of every combat encounter, the involved parties (= groups) must roll for initiative. In order to determine which party gets to act first, each party rolls a **D100**. The party rolling the higher number, goes first. If there is a tie, roll another **D100**. 

The involved parties act one after another. After all involed parties have had their **turn** to act, a **combat round** has passed. All members of a party act at the same time, during the party's turn. 

If one party is surprised, the ambushing party gets to act for a full turn, without initiative being rolled. This is called a *surprise round*. After the surprise round, initiative is rolled and combat begins as explained above. A party is considered surprised if they were unaware of their opponents when the first attack roll happens. 

> As an example: this does not count for opponents standing right in front of each other in conversation, when one of them suddenly draws a dagger and attacks. The attacker can be clearly seen by the defender and thus they must both roll for initiative, to determine whether the defender can react in time. 

## Combat Actions
Every turn, every character gets 3 **Action Points (AP)** to spend on actions during their turn. 

Any basic action, so any action not requiring a test, costs 1 **AP**. Any action requiring a test, costs 2 **AP**. Skill abilities cost the amount of **AP** as noted on them. 

A character can move up to 15'/5m per **AP** spent. In **difficult terrain**, the distance moved per **AP** is 6'/2m. 

Speaking or shouting a short phrase is free. If you want to have a proper conversation, that will have to take multiple rounds. 

If the turn is ended with any **AP** unspent, they go towards the character's [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi) and [ranged defence](#ranged-defence-agi), as **+1D6** per **AP**. 

## How to Attack
Attacks are made using a [weapon skill](#weapon--weapon-type--str), [magic-school skill](#magic-school--school--arc) or a **skill-ability**. 

Defending against [single-target attacks](#single-target-attack) is an automatic reaction. An [opposed test](#opposed-test) must be made. 

Defending against [area of effect attacks](#area-of-effect-attack) is either impossible or an active choice, as a reaction. <br>
It is possible to defend against a magical **aoe** attack, by using the [counter-magic](#counter-magic) skill. 

If the attacker wins the [opposed test](#opposed-test) or if they used an **aoe** attack that couldn't/wasn't countered or dodged, they get to roll for damage. If the defender wins, no damage is dealt. 

[Unarmed combat](#unarmed) is handled like a weapon skill. 

### Attack-Targeting
There are two types of attack targeting methods: **Single-target** and **area of effect** (**aoe**).

#### Single-Target Attack
Any **single-target** attack can be dodged or defended against. To do so, an [opposed test](#opposed-test) is made. If the defender wins no damage is dealt. 

Against melee attacks, the defender must test their [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi). 

Against ranged attacks, the defender must test their [ranged defence](#ranged-defence-agi).

#### Area of Effect Attack
**Area of Effect** (**aoe**) attacks can only be dodged or defended against under certain conditions. 

If the **aoe** attack is magical and would affect a mage, that defending mage can choose to use their skill [counter-magic](#counter-magic), to try and counter the attack. If they choose to counter the spell, an [opposed test](#opposed-test) must be made. If the defender wins no damage is dealt. 

The defending mage incurs the same stamina cost as the attacker, when they cast the spell. However, every degree of success of the defender reduces their [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) cost by one. 

> A mage casts [pyromancy](#pyromancy) at another, at intensity level 6. That incurs the attacker a [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) cost of 6. 
> 
> The defender chooses to use their [counter-magic](#counter-magic). Now, an opposed test must be made. 
> 
> The attacker has an [arcana](#arcana-arc) of 5 and [pyromancy](#pyromancy) skill level of 6. They get to roll **8D6**. 
> 
> The defender has an [arcana](#arcana-arc) of 4 and [counter-magic](#counter-magic) skill of 5. They get to roll **7D6**. 
> 
> The defender achieves 4 **positives**, whereas the attacker only achieves 3 **positives**. That means, that the attack spell fails. The degree of success is 1, which reduces the [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) cost of the defender by 1. Thus, they incur a [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) cost of 5.  

It is only possible to use [counter-magic](#counter-magic), if the defender has at least one [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) left. 

If the **aoe** attack is of a non-magical nature, it may only be possible to dodge or defend against, if the **GM** allows for it. 

> A thrown bomb may perhaps be caught and thrown back at the attacker. But a cannon shot cannot be warded off. 

If there is no way to reasonable dodge or defend against the **aoe** attack, its damage is rolled right away. 

### Special Types of Attack
Sometimes, simply *hitting it* isn't enough. Sometimes, more control is needed. These rules outline how a character can do more specific attacks. 

#### Aimed Attack
An attack generally targets the center of mass (torso) of the targeted opponent. 

It is, however, possible to call out wanting to attack a specific part of an opponent's body. Generally, this means that the attack must be rolled at greater **Ob**. However, the **GM** can also decide the part being targeted is fairly easy to hit, either generally or due to current circumstance, so no disadvantage is incurred. 

A player may call out what effect the aimed attack is supposed to have, such as limiting their opponent's ability to stand, move, attack or whatever else the body part may be useful for. If they don't, the **GM** decides the effect. 

#### Difficult Attack
There may be attacks that are more difficult to perform, due to current circumstance. Such attack rolls are penalized with a higher **Ob**. 

An example for a *difficult attack* would be targeting an opponent with a ranged weapon when the opponent is behind cover. 

Another example would be attacking backwards, at an invisible target or with a broken arm, and so on.

#### Easy Attack
Some attacks may be easier to perform. An **easy attack** has a lower **Ob**.

The following are generally considered easy attacks (but at the **GM**'s discretion):
* From behind
* Against prone opponents
* Against restrained opponents

#### Execution Attack
The extreme version of an easy attack, the **execution attack** allows outright killing or maiming an opponent, without having to roll for an attack or for damage. 

Such an attack can be carried out against any character who is unable to resist (with the exception of player characters, see [death's door](#deaths-door)). 

> An unconscious character, or one chained to the wall couldn't possibly resist and can be instantaneously killed with an **execution attack**. 

This kind of attack is only possible at the **GM**'s discretion. 

# Magic
Any character with [arcana](#arcana-arc), can cast magic. What kind of magic, depends on the [magic schools](#magic-schools) the character knows. 

While not all spells can be used offensively, those that can, will inflict [damage](#health--exhaustion), proportional to the [spell's intensity](#spell-intensity) and may cause other effects on those affected by it. 

The effects of a spell do not affect the mage casting the spell, unless they suffer a [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire). 

## Magic Stamina
**Magic stamina** represents a mage's capacity for casting magic without risk to themselves. 

Note that it is possible for a mage to cast spells that costs more **magic stamina** than they have available. 

Thus, it represents the threshold of safely casting magic. Any magic that costs more **magic stamina** than is available, can cause a [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire). 

This threshold is reduced every time a spell is cast. The threshold is reduced by the [intensity](#spell-intensity) at which the spell was cast. Success or failure doesn't matter - even just the attempt to cast the spell incurs the **magic stamina** cost. 

For every point past the current threshold that a spell costs, one **D6** must be rolled. <br>
If a 1 or a 2 is rolled, the spell [spell-backfires](#spell-backfire), dealing its full damage to the caster, instead. 

How much **magic stamina** a mage has available to them, is derived from their [arcana](#arcana-arc) attribute + the total level of all their known [magic school](#magic-school--school--arc) skill levels, divided by two and rounded up. 

> If a mage has an **arcana** of 3 and has the **magic school skills** **pyromancy** at level 3, **cryomancy** at level 2 and **counter-magic** at level 5, that means they have (3 + 3 + 2 + 5) / 2 = 7 **magic stamina**. 

## Spell Intensity
Any magic can be cast at different **intensities**. A greater **spell intensity** results in a greater effect, at a proportionally greater [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) cost. 

### Maximum Spell Intensity
A mage can only cast spells at an intensity up to a certain limit, called their **maximum spell intensity**. This number directly correlates to their skill in the type of [magic school](#magic-schools) they wish to use. 

This means, for every [school of magic](#magic-schools) the mage knows, they may have a different **maximum spell intensity**. 

## Spell-Backfire
A spell-backfire causes a spell to affect the caster, instead of their intended target. 

In case of an [aoe](#area-of-effect-attack) attack spell, anything nearby, in range, also receives the damage, unless if they can [counter-magic](#counter-magic) it.

The mage suffers the full damage and/or effect of the spell. If anything or anyone nearby is affected, they also suffer the full damage and/or effect of the spell. 

A **spell-backfire** can occur, if a mage is casting a spell that costs more [magic stamina](#magic-stamina) than they have left. 

## Magic Things
**Ambersteel** takes its name from the in-game material of the same name. As it is a strictly anti-magic material, it should enjoy great attention in any fantasy world, where magic is a real and recognizable force. Where usually, magic is the centerpiece, in **Ambersteel** that isn't quite the case. Magic is powerful and fearsome and thus, if not under control, can threaten to cause great pain and destruction. **Ambersteel** dampens that power and puts shackles on it. 

But there are also other materials and important things related to magic, as described in this section. 

### Abyssalite
**Abyssalite** is a hard and brittle mineral, that has the ability to *amplify the flow of magic*. It can only be acquired from the depths of the earth and is fairly rare. 

Its surface is unnaturally smooth and covered in a fine, iridescent shine. Underneath the smooth surface, one searches for depth and color in vain. It is as though the void itself is being contained by that iridescent shell. 

**Abyssalite** is a hard and brittle mineral, prone to shattering if too much force is applied. This makes it difficult to shape. It is also fairly heavy, which makes it difficult to carry long. 

A fist-sized **Abyssalite** chunk has a [bulk](#carrying-capacity) of 2 and grants one greater [spell intensity](#spell-intensity), but without costing any [exhaustion](#exhaustion). In order to use the **Abyssalite**, the caster must be touching it. 

### Amberite
As magic is amplified by [Abyssalite](#abyssalite), its antithesis is called **Amberite**, a metal which dulls the effects of magic and slows any magic flow nearby it. The material is also known to affect magic creatures and can cause great pain in magic-users. 

Weapons made from **Amberite** are quite popular with witch and monster hunters alike, although fairly hard to come by, due to the difficulty in **Amberite** processing. 

**Amberite** is a crystalline material, that can be molten down and shaped, like iron. It glows weakly, in the fiery orange of the name-sharing amber stone. Near the edges, the glow fades to a dull reflection, like cooling molten glass. 

It only occurs naturally in a few select places in the world, where the ground offers the right conditions. **Amberite** grows over time, in the right environment. It can take several decades for a finger-sized crystal to grow to the size of an adult man's forearm. Attempts to cultivate it have mostly failed, as **Amberite** farmers have so far been unable to understand and reproduce the right conditions for it to thrive. Due to the slow rate at which it grows, an **Amberite** farmer may not realize the lack of growth until well into a decade later. 

Prolonged exposure to **Amberite** causes severe ill-effects with nausea and migranes being common symptoms. 

### Ambersteel
[Amberite](#amberite) can be processed into **Ambersteel**, which makes it a hard and flexible metal. The raw material heats slowly and must be heated over the course of several days and nights, without interruption. When it finally reaches the right temperature, it will glow white, with a purple sheen. At that point, it can be hammered into shape. Constant re-heating ensures it stays at the right temperature and a final quenching in vegetable oil ensures it retains its flexibility. 

If processed outside the optimal temperature, the material quickly grows brittle and will shatter if any stress is put on it.

Due to the length of the process and the difficulty in keeping the right temperature, smiths capable of creating **Ambersteel** are rare. 

### Runes
Shards of [Abyssalite](#abyssalite) can have runes carved into them, which allow magic to flow through the runes. This renders runes extremely powerful artifacts, as they can allow for near limitless magic-use, even in the hands of a non-mage. 

To activate such a rune, is a difficult skill to learn, however. Even if no innate magical ability is required, an understanding of the flow of magic is. The rune must be touched in the right spots, at the right intervals, to activate successfully. Mistakes in this procedure can have disastrous results. 

What's more, it takes great skill to carve the right runes, as each rune's shape and complexity depends in part on the size and shape of the [Abyssalite](abyssalite) shard. The only way to get it right, is to *feel* the way the rune must be shaped. Alternatively, the shard can be adjusted to be of equivalent size and shape, but this requires considerable effort, as [Abyssalite](abyssalite) is a brittle material, prone to shattering if too much force is applied. 

In order to craft a **rune**:
* A **rune** can only be made to cast one type of magic. So the carver has to pick one of the [magic schools](#magic-schools). 
* The maximum **level** at which a **rune** can be created, depends on the carver's skill. The **level** of the **rune** dictates the [spell intensity](#spell-intensity) it will cast its spell at. 
* The carver has to succeed a [rune carving](#rune-carving-arc) skill test. 
  * If they fail, the carving is botched and the [Abyssalite chunk](#abyssalite) cannot be used for another carving attempt. There is no room for mistakes. 

In order to invoke a **rune**:
* A **complete success** of a [rune-using](#rune-using-agi) skill test will invoke the spell of the **rune** as expected.
* A **partial success** or **complete failure** results in a [spell-backfire](#spell-backfire). 

# Game Mastery
This section is directed at (and somewhat reserved for) the Game Master (**GM**) - the one person at the table who everyone agrees has the authority and burden to run the game. 

## The Role Of A Game Master
As the **GM**, you are the one person at the table playing a different game than the others. Instead of controlling a single character in a given world, you control the entire world and determine what the characters within it get to do. 

You're the one who decides on the tone of the world. Is it grimdark? Or perhaps heroic, instead? What adventure(s) will the players be engaging in? Murder mystery? Grand strategy? A heist? Perhaps nothing quite so specific. Perhaps you'll simply present them with a mix of adventures and see which one they pick. You should be clear about this, before you even interview your first player. 

You're also the one who organizes everything. On what days are your play sessions going to be on? What time? What do you do, if someone can't make it? Do you play without them or do you have boardgames at the read for such an occasion? 

Who will get to be at your table and play in your game? You'll have to decide on that, too. You may involve your players in the process of judging the fitness of potential candidates, but ultimately, the final say lies with you. 

How will you run the game? Will it be a single play session (= one-shot) or a perpetual game? Do you want the game to be on-site, at your house or perhaps online? Will you use a webcam and do you expect your players to show themselves via webcam? 

It is *your world* and *your game*. The other people at the table are *your players*. Find the right players for your world and your game and make your game and world right for your players. 

### Your World
While **Ambersteel** is best suited to a medieval-fantasy world, it doesn't dictate the type of world you have to employ. 

You are encouraged to craft your own world to play in. You decide what species (like humans) exist, what nations and cultures vow for supremacy and what fantastical landscapes exist. Is magic prevalent? What types of magic exist? You decide. This world, is yours. 

Your players can aid in crafting the world. Usually during play, rather than outside of it. If you allow them to change your world through their actions, it becomes a much more dynamic and almost life-like beast. 

#### **Bring NPCs To Life**
Non-player characters (**NPC**s) are all the people of your world, that aren't the **PC**s. **NPC**s are one of your most important tools to bring your world to life and make it interesting and engaging to your players. More often than not, the most interesting sessions involve heavy or mindful use of **NPC**s. See them as you do real people. There are no rules or mechanics dictating how they should behave. 

Much like the **PC**s, or in fact real people, **NPC**s lead their own lives, with their own ambitions, beliefs, instincts, strengths and weaknesses. Keeping track of all of the numbers that implies, can become quite the challenge. But you won't have to come up with all those numbers right away.

Whenever the **PC**s encounter someone new, all you really need, is a rough idea of *who* that **NPC** *is*. You don't have to know all their history right away, nor all of their strengths, weaknesses or even their agenda. Invent those as needed and just keep notes on that. 

And *who* an **NPC** is, depends on several factors, such as:
* their social status (e. g. a noble vs. a peasant)
* their cultural background
* their physique
* their occupation (e. g. a carpenter vs. a professional soldier)
* their financial status
* what you *think* their agenda *should be*

While putting on an accent and visibly acting out the quirks of an **NPC** certainly helps in bringing them to life, what's more important is how they interact with the **PC**s. Are they supportive of the **PC**s? Do they offer a warm meal whenever they see the **PC**s or do they bar their door and close the window curtains? Do they stand up defiantly or cower meekly, when they interact with the **PC**s?

More often than not, you'll have **NPC**s be the source of quests and adventures for the **PC**s. But you can also have some **NPC**s that work for the **PC**s. This, especially, gives players a greater sense of agency, in your world. It allows them to move pieces on the board, so to speak. 

You also get to use **NPC**s as a tool to feed players information (or false rumors) about the world they're in. Be careful how you approach this, though. Players have a tendency to assume everything the **GM** says is true. So when an **NPC** feeds them false information, they tend not to question it. Before you can effectively use false information as a tool, you'll have to establish that **NPC**s will not always speak the truth. Perhaps by introducing an **NPC** very early on, who will tell the most outrageous lies. Maybe even about the **PC**s. That would certainly make your players sceptical. But the specifics of this are entirely up to you and your specific game. 

#### Use The Senses
When you describe scenes, not just what one can see is of relevance. What are the **PC**s' other senses picking up? What about hearing? Smell? Do the mages sense the flow of magic? What's the temperature like? Is the air damp or dry? Is the ground trembling from a giant's heavy footfalls?

Try to pick only the most significant and most symbolic influences on the senses for your scene. There is little point in describing the gentle rustle of the wind in the leaves, whenever the **PC**s enter a forest. But if there is a strong stench of decay in the air, then that's probably noteworthy. 

More often than not, players would be on the look-out for anything out of the ordinary in a given scene. So anything obvious to the **PC**s, anything that *should* stand out to them, you should describe to them. And that includes smells, noises, temperature, humidity, etc. 

Of course, sometimes, describing a peaceful and soothing scene can be a welcome and effective change. After a harrowing fight, the **PC**s might enter a safe area, where you describe it as a peaceful meadow or serene village or anything along those lines. 

### Your Game
There is an *unspoken social contract* between you, the **GM** and your players. Everyone at the table agrees that you get to call the shots. You present every scenario and the challenges that go with it. The players have to come up with the answers and solutions. 

The rules are also in your hands. If you find one of the **Ambersteel** rules to not be to your liking or simply not work in your game, change it, so that it fits your game. This is called *house-ruling* - introducing unofficial rules that are only in effect at your table. 

Keep in mind that with this authority, also comes responsibility. It is your task, to entertain your players. Not like a comedian or a singer, but something more varied and complex than that. You agree to keep your players interested and engaged in your game. You agree to weave their characters into stories of which you'll have no idea where they'll go. 

And you agree to mediate and moderate. When players fight, in-person, then there may be a time when you, as the one running the game have to step in and find a resolution. Either you can find a way for them to reconcile, or someone may have to leave the game. 

When players keep talking over each other, it is your responsibility to moderate. Have them take turns when speaking. Make sure everyone who has something to say, gets to. 

Even if all of these and the following points may sound very dogmatic, see them more as well-intentioned advice, than hard rules for you to follow. Find your style and develop it as you like. 

#### To Rule or Not To Rule
The rules serve to facilitate the resolution of uncertain outcomes, to add tension and drama and introduce challenges for the players to deal with. 

Obviously, as the **GM**, you have to know the rules well, in order to keep the game paced well. Keep in mind, however, that the rules can also get in the way of *your game's* pacing. 

Rules discussions and looking up rules is best kept for later. Keep the game flowing or else risk losing the interest of your players! That means making a ruling now, based on what you *think* might be the right call in the given situation. Then, later, when the players are busy, or when you're taking a break, you can look up what the right rule might have been. 

When a player tries to argue a ruling, they're violating the unspoken social contract. Tell them it's time to move on and address their questions and concerns after the session. 

### Your Players
The game can only happen, because of your players - the people willing to be at your table and engage with your game. Treat them with the same respect you expect from them. 

You're primarily running this game for your players - without them, you might as well write a book, instead. Therefore it should be your top priority to keep them entertained and focused on the game, or else you risk losing them. 

Understand how your players think and how they enjoy their table-top role-playing game experience. If they like combat and loathe interacting with **NPC**s, you can cater to that and present them with lots of *interesting* combat scenarios. On the other hand, if they love to role-play, they'll probably enjoy meeting and interacting with **NPC**s. 

Figuring out how to get your players engaged in your game and noticing that engagement, can be a very rewarding sensation. It is a sign of a fun and worth-while experience. 

But not just the conflicts within game itself require your attention. When two players fight, you'll have to step in, if they can't resolve the matter themselves. Try to mediate, when possible. And have the wisdom to tell when reconciliation is impossible. As difficult as it may be, sometimes you'll have to let a player go, if they don't fit into the group. 

Besides the mediator, you're also the moderator. Make sure your players are respectful towards each other, as well, by stopping players talking over each other. 

This, and all the tips in the *your game* section serve as tools to keep the game paced well and filled with interesting and engaging content. A well-paced game is one that keeps the players' interest. 

## How To Master Your Game
While the previous section gives a broad overview of the expectations of a **GM**, this sections aims to help you fulfill those expectations. 

### Starting Your Session
#### Recap The Last Session
A good start for every session is asking one of your players (volunteers first) to outline what their characters did and experienced in the last session. This refreshes everyone's memory on what they did and should be doing. It also encourages them to take notes during play. 

It is important you only correct them on crucial plot points, which they really should get right. Keep in mind that players tend to see the **GM**'s word as **absolute truth**. This is why, when you re-tell the events and those differ from what the players remember, it might alienate them from the world and the story. They thought they understood what was going on, but then you correct them and prove they were wrong all along - that is frustrating and harmful. 

In fact, you may even correct some of the details of how events *actually* played out, based on what your players re-tell. Do so silently, though. The last thing you want, is to encourage *meta-gaming*, where your players intentionally recap the last session incorrectly, in a way to make you change details in their characters' favor. 

#### Read Out Ambitions, Beliefs & Instincts
Once the last session has been refreshed, move on to have every player, one by one, read out aloud to all, their character's ambition (keep this one brief), current **beliefs** and current **instincts**. 

There are two reasons to do this:
1. The other players can know, if a belief targets their character. So if a **PC** (player) starts acting odd towards another player (their **PC**), that player knows it's part of the role-play and not directed towards them as a person. <br>
It also allows the player whose character is targeted by the belief to form ideas on how to react to it. 
2. It lets you know the **ambitions**, **beliefs** and **instincts** of your **PC**s. And you have to know those, to be able to *challenge* them. <br> 
You certainly don't *have to* make your players read their **beliefs** out aloud, to know them, but this keeps the busiwork on your part down. And you have enough work to do, as it is. 

Be mindful that players knowing the **beliefs** of their fellow **PC**s should not be allowed to meta-game. 

> If a **PC** has a belief to the detriment of their fellow **PC** and this is a fresh belief, the targeted **PC** shouldn't suddenly become more suspicious towards their ally. At least not without sufficient reason. Of course, a **PC** can figure out another's intentions, but not by virtue of their owning player knowing. 

#### Read Out Fate Point Purchases
Once **ambitions**, **beliefs** and **instincts** are handled, move on to what meta-powers players purchased with their [fate points](#fate-points). 

Everyone should be clear on what everyone else can do, especially since these are strictly meta-game powers. 

### Your Session
While running the session, you'll have the most work and the toughest job. Listen to your players attentively, react and improvise as needed. 

You'll have to keep a lot of rules in mind. This section aims to provide a set of reminders. 

#### Choosing **Ob**
Choosing the right **Ob** for a test is a difficult task, for which clear rules cannot be easily written. More times than not, your gut-feeling will have to tell you which number is *right* for the given test. 

* T - Trivial
* E - Easy
* D - Difficult
* C - Challenging
* Blanks are impossible

The following table provides a decent point of orientation for **attribute** tests: 
Level | **Ob** 1 | **Ob** 2 | **Ob** 3 | **Ob** 4 | **Ob** 5 | **Ob** 6 | **Ob** 7 | **Ob** 8 | **Ob** 9 | **Ob** 10
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1  | C |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 
| 2  | C | C |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 
| 3  | D | C | C |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | 
| 4  | E | D | C | C |   |   |   |   |   |   | 
| 5  | E | D | D | C | C |   |   |   |   |   | 
| 6  | T | E | D | D | C | C |   |   |   |   | 
| 7  | T | T | E | E | D | C | C |   |   |   | 
| 8  | T | T | T | E | E | D | C | C |   |   | 
| 9  | T | T | T | E | E | D | C | C | C |   | 
| 10 | T | T | T | E | E | D | D | C | C | C | 

The following table provides a decent point of orientation for **skill** tests: 
Level | **Ob** 1 | **Ob** 2 | **Ob** 3 | **Ob** 4 | **Ob** 5 | **Ob** 6 | **Ob** 7 | **Ob** 8 | **Ob** 9 | **Ob** 10
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 1  | D | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | 
| 2  | D | D | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | 
| 3  | D | D | D | C | C | C | C | C | C | C | 
| 4  | E | D | D | D | C | C | C | C | C | C | 
| 5  | E | E | D | D | D | C | C | C | C | C | 
| 6  | T | E | E | D | D | D | C | C | C | C | 
| 7  | T | T | E | E | D | D | D | C | C | C | 
| 8  | T | T | T | E | E | D | D | D | C | C | 
| 9  | T | T | T | E | E | D | D | D | D | C | 
| 10 | T | T | T | T | E | E | D | D | D | D | 

When to test either an **attribute**, or a **skill**, also requires a certain gut-feeling. **Attribute**s are typically the raw, innate abilities of a character. 
**Skills** on the other hand are learned abilities. 

#### Challenging Your Players
You have two means of challenging (= engaging) your players: *mechanical challenges* and *narrative challenges*. 

Mechanical challenges are your *game-y* tools to engage your players. You engage them, by challenging their characters. You put tests or limitations before them, which have to be overcome mechanically. Dice are usually involved. 

You should be intimately familiar with the [tests](#tests) section. When to use what type of test can not be cast in a sure-fire ruleset, and rather requires you to develop a sense for it. **Creative tests** allow your players the most freedom and should thus be the most interesting way for them to resolve a mechanical challenge. But over-use this type of test and your players might start feeling irritated and mentally exhausted too quickly. 

[Injuries](#injury) and [illnesses](#illness) involve mechanical hurdles for the **PC**s to overcome. The solution is presented in the rules. If you're injured or ill, seek medical aid and spend time resting. While some of the player party may be incapacitated, the other half can roll some dice to have their character [practice their skills](#practice) or [practice their attributes](#practicing-attributes). Of course, these aren't terribly interesting mechanical challenges, because they leave little room for interpretation. 

##### **Challenge your PCs' abilities during combat**
More interesting scenarios come from challenging your **PC**s' abilities. Present the close-quarters warrior with an opponent who's out of reach. Have the blood-letting fanatic deal with a foe that can't bleed. Present the mage with an opponent clad in [Amberite](#amberite). But always keep in mind one thing - the foes your players engage should have weaknesses and they should not be unbeatable, unless you make it **very** clear to the players their characters couldn't win a straight fight. 

Also try to occasionally have foes that target the **PC** they counter, but also make sure one of the other **PC**s can counter them, in turn. 

> The player party's mage is ambushed by an [Amberite](#amberite)-clad fanatic. The mage shoots fire at their assailant, but finds the fire dissipate into nothing more than hot smoke right before the fanatic's eyes. But the mage's ally, a halberd-wielding ex-footsoldier jumps in and lands a devastating blow, severly injuring the fanatic. 
> 
> The wounded fanatic cannot fight on and attempts to flee. The **PC**s can now attempt to attack the fleeing fanatic with conventional means, or let them go. The mage alone might not have had such an easy time of it. But thanks to their ally, they didn't have to fear that foe. 

Even more interesting fights can occur, if you involve the environment, as well. Introduce both hazards and tools for the **PC**s to be threatened by, or to exploit. These are just some examples of interactive combat environments: 
* An illegal gunpowder storage. Any careless use of fire could cause a cascade of explosions. Be mindful to not straight-up wipe out the **PC**s if the gunpowder does get set on fire. They should be harmed, but give them a chance to recover or flee from that blunder. 
* A giant cave, full of giant spider webs. If anyone should be unfortunate enough to stumble or be knocked into a web, a giant spider descends from the shadowy corners of the ceiling and begins to threaten that chracter, specifically. If that happens to be a **PC**, their allies have to think quick, to get them free, but also keep their original opponents on their toes. On the other hand, the **PC**s can attempt to knock their foes into the webs. 
* A burning house, with the **PC**s and their opponents in the thick of it. At the start of every turn, a burning piece of debris falls from the ceiling and you randomly determine where it lands. Could be on a **PC**, could be on one of their opponents. Or it could be in front of and barring their only exit - an open window leading to safety. 
* A rickety, old bridge, which could collapse if too much force was applied to its support beams. The **PC**s could exploit this to collapse the bridge on purpose. Or their opponents could attempt the same, to put time-pressure on the players. 

##### **Challenge your PCs' abilities out of combat**
Outside of combat, you can challenge your **PC**s' skills. Present opportunities for the **PC**s to [learn new things](#advancing-skills). Present them with tests for skills they don't have. But do so sparingly. It is frustrated for a player to never get to play to their character's strengths. Give players that satisfaction of having *the right skill at the right time*. 

When it comes to skill tests, it is prudent to be wary of *test band-wagon'ing*. When you ask a specific player (or rather, their character) to do a test in a certain skill or attribute and if they fail, another player jumps in and asks, if they can try, consider well how you answer. 

If you allow it, you make the player you first asked feel less special and important. After all, you must have had a good reason why *only their character* could do the test, to begin with. If you found that only that one **PC** had a chance at even attempting the test, you shouldn't allow other **PC**s to make the test. 

> A classic example is asking one of your players to test their character's [perception](#perception-perc). They fail and the other players immediately ask if they can try, as well. If they could, you shouldn't have asked just the one player, but instead asked all of them to begin with. 
> 
> But if you think only their character could have succeeded that test, you shouldn't allow the others to try. 

On the other hand, you should only have such specifically targeted tests, if failure doesn't result in a dead-end for the **PC**s. Try to aim more towards tests that can result in the players being informed of a potential challenge ahead of time. 

> For example, a sneaky **PC** might have successfully infiltrated a palace, where they aim to gather intelligence on their political enemies. The **GM** asks them to do a [perception](#perception-perc) test, which they succeed. As a result, the **GM** informs the player, that their character overhears voices from a room next door. 
> 
> The **PC** walks up to the door leading to the other room, and eavedrops. They overhear two men talking about increased patrols and sightings of an intruder. The player decides, based on that information, to leave the palace early, as things are getting too risky for them to stay. 
> 
> Had the **PC** failed their test, the **GM** would have told them to move on. Perhaps even given them a different piece of information, like hearing noises outside the room they're in, but without a clear direction. The player might not think much of it, and decide to stay. That's when the guards walk in and surprise the **PC**. They can still make their get-away, albeit involving more running in blind panic, than sneaking calmly. 

##### **Fewer Tests Are Better**
Only have a player make one test per scene/situation, as long as the scene/situation doesn't change significantly. 

> For example, a **PC** is trying to sneak past two guards huddled around a campfire. If they succeed their [stealth](#stealth-agi) test, the **GM** lets them sneak all around the camp, without making them do multiple tests, as long as the situation doesn't change significantly. One of the guards getting up to take a pee behind a tree somewhere shouldn't be such a change, even if that happens to be the tree the **PC** is hiding behind. On the other hand, if the guards pick up torches and start actively looking for intruders, for whatever reason, then the situation changes significantly. Another [stealth](#stealth-agi) test would be warranted. 

> A **PC** succeeds an [acrobatics](#acrobatics-agi) test to climb a wall. Thus, it is established that the **PC** *can* climb that wall. Whenever they attempt to climb that wall in the future, they simply succeed, with no test needed. Unless, of course, if the wall got taller since the last attempt. 

Of course, how many tests are appropriate in a given situation is entirely at your discretion. 

##### **Limit Resources**
Also keep in mind that the [item slots](#carrying-capacity) system exists to create mechanical challenges. Limit the **PC**'s access to the resources they tend to hoard. 

Although your players could also be clever and find narrative solutions to their lack of *item vaccuuming*. If they can afford one or two carriages with the horses and drivers, perhaps even guards, they should be allowed to transport a lot more stuff around. Within the confines of their solution, of course. Those wagons full of ammunition, medical supplies and spare daggers will have to stay outside the cave/dungeon/ruin/etc. - unless your players can find a solution for that, too. 

Possessions in the form of coin and steel are not the only type of resource you can give your **PC**s. Keep in mind that servants, hirelings, close friends and family are *also a resource*. **PC**s can refer to them, when they have need of information, coin or political support. 

##### **Challenge Your PCs' Beliefs**
And that brings us to narrative challenges. These are the challenges you present your players, moreso than their characters. 

Still bordering on *game-y*, the [ambitions, beliefs and instincts](#ambitions-beliefs--instincts) and [fate points](#fate-points) systems reward players for role-playing well and for playing to their character's beliefs. 

Make sure to regularly challenge **each** **PC**'s **beliefs** and **instincts**. You do so, by confronting them with a situation in which, if they act in accordance with their belief, it gets them or their allies *in trouble*. 

This keeps the players on their toes and puts pressure on them when they have to make a difficult call. Will they play to their character's belief - and get them in trouble - or do they refuse and thus violate the belief? This is also where a large part of the *easy role-playing* comes from, because it is mechanically supported. 

More interesting and less immediately rewarding, is the **ambition** of a **PC**. These long-term goals guide their character along the way. Make sure to throw them a small plot to advance their own agenda, every once in a while. 

> For example, a **PC** has an old enemy who they've vowed to take revenge on. While the final confrontation is still a ways away, every once in a while, that **PC** finds information regarding their enemy. You could feed that player information on their **PC**'s enemy's current or recent whereabouts and activities. Not enough to give them a trail to follow, but enough to keep them aware of their long-term goal. 
> 
> Then, you present them with an opportunity to steal some resource from their enemy. Be it a valuable item, person or political power - something is within reach. This will likely be its own small adventure for the player party to engage with - if they so choose. 
> 
> Eventually, some henchmen of the **PC**'s enemy make an appearance. They aim to challenge the player party. This is important - not just the one **PC** is involved, but **all of them**. This makes the **PC**'s *personal concern*, a *party concern*. 
> 
> And so it goes on, with continually more escalating scenarios, which all culminate into the final confrontation, many real-world sessions into the future, when the **PC** gets to put the final nail in that **ambition**'s coffin - and earn their [AFP](#ambition-fate-points).

##### **Anchor Your PCs Down**
Another resource, is a base of operations. This is a very meaningful and powerful tool, to anchor your **PC**s to a particular domain. Expect them to want to return to their base of operations regularly. While this *may* narrow the radius of exploration your players are willingly to go, it doesn't necessarily have to. What it is guaranteed to do, however, is make your players care about *that space* in the world, in particular. 

Be mindful *where* in the world you give them such a resource, because that is where the players will want to spend a lot of time at. Make sure it is a location where quests can easily come to them. Damsels in distress, kings in need and wealthy merchants all need a reachable door to knock at. A very remote location might not see a lot of *action* or *visitors*. 

##### **Threaten Your PCs**
Any resource you let a **PC** have, can be *threatened*. This is a powerful tool to raise tension among your players. Threaten their possessions, family or holdings - all the things they hold dear. 

This is a powerful tool to make the players care about protecting their assets. If you have given them a small castle in a sparsely populated area, make sure to have someone threaten to take away that castle at least (or at most) **once**. By the time that happens, the players should have grown accustomed to having that safe space to return and haul loot to. Suddenly, their top-priority will be protecting that place. 

Once they've fended off the attackers, they'll really start caring about everything that's happening on or near their home turf. This is when wars and rumors become of much greater relevance to your players, as they don't want their assets (which they before took for granted) threatened *again*. 

In order to avoid frustrating your players, you shouldn't threaten their more valuable resources often. Used sparingly, this tool can cause great tension and players scrambling to find a creative solution. But used too frequently, your players might start getting frustrated, because you harm their sense of progression. If they never truly gain anything, why *should* they care if it is threatened? 

##### **Allow World-Change**
Have your players change your world. No matter what they do, the **PC**s' actions are going to leave ripples running through the world. 

If they ruthlessly slaughter a tribe of non-humans, they might inadvertently cause an increased radicalization among the other tribes of those same non-humans. Likewise, if the **PC**s go around protecting villages against raids, those villages might prosper and the villagers might offer gifts (like a warm meal and bed) to the **PC**s. 

On the other hand, if the players are actively trying to change a major aspect of the world, like the political structure in a neighboring country, allow it - but make it difficult. The players will have to work a bit to achieve that goal. Not just in terms of time invested, but in terms of creative preparation. 

This is the most powerful way to narratively challenge players. It helps them see your fictional world as *real* and they start thinking about the consequences of their actions more often. This encourages peaceful and creative solutions, where before they might have preferred blunt violence. 

### Ending Your Session
#### Hand Out Fate Points
You end every session by nominating players for [fate points](#fate-points) they earned during play. Players should also nominate and vote for each other. Whether someone gets their **FP** is based on majority vote. 

If you're short on time and have to end the session without voting for [fate points](#fate-points), make sure to do so at the start of the next session!

#### Gather Feedback
While entirely up to you, it is always a good idea to gather feedback from your players. 

You could ask them the following:
* What was your favorite moment of today's session?
* What was your least favorite moment of today's session?
* Was the balance of combat vs. role-play to your liking?
* (If there was NPC-interaction) What was your favorite **NPC** interaction today?
  * Take note - that is an NPC you can *threaten* later, and have that player *care*. 

# Appendix
The appendix contains important and less important lists, for reference only when needed. 

## Skill List
The following list does not and cannot aim to be a complete listing of all possible skills in game. Adding new skills as necessary will have to be done by the **GM**. 

Some skills have a list of **skill abilities** that a character unlocks, if they reach a certain level in that skill. A **skill ability** has one or more effects and one or more conditions that restrict when they're applicable. 

Using a **skill ability** counts as an **action**. 

For a human, a skill at level 10 represents absolute mastery. It is possible to go higher than that, but only with great effort. The average level a human could reasonably have in a skill they've been practicing for months, should be around 3 or 4. Only years of experience allow for a 5 or higher. Anything higher than 5 should be considered excellence.

## List of Magic Schools
Noted for each spell intensity, are the effects of the spell and the maximum distance, from the caster, at which the spell can be cast or the distance up to which it can have an effect. 

If applicable, damage inflicted, exhaustion inflicted and other such effects, will also be noted. 

### Pyromancy

Injuries inflicted are of the [burning](#burning) damage type. 

| Spell Intensity | Damage Inflicted | Max Distance | Effect(s) |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------ | --------- |
| 1  | 0 | 0      | A small, controlled flame erupts and stays in the mage's hand. Alternatively, a small flame (like a candle flame) in immediate proximity of the mage is extinguished. |
| 2  | 1D3 **Burning** | 3'/1m  | A moderate torch fire erupts and stays in the mage's hand. Or a torch in immediate proximity of the mage is extinguished. |

| 3  | 1D3 **Freezing** | 1D3 | 15'/5m | An ice-shard forms from whatever liquid is in the mage's hands. It can be shot at a nearby spot of the mage's choosing. The impacted spot freezes over. |
| 4  | 1D3 + 1 **Freezing** | 2D3 | 30'/10m | A large ice-shard forms in the mage's hands, without requiring any liquid. It can be shot at a moderately distant spot of the mage's choosing. The impacted spot freezes over. |
| 5  | 2D3 **Freezing** | 1D6 | 30'/10m | A large area of the mage's choosing, at moderate distance from the mage, freezes over. |
| 6+ | N-3 D3 **Freezing** | 1D6 + N-5 | 30'/10m | N = spell intensity; A torrent of ice and snow forms in a large area of the mage's choosing, at moderate distance. Anything within it, freezes over. |

### Restoration
The mending of injuries and treatment of diseases.

## Armor Types
Armor reduces damage to its wearer by a flat amount. By how much, is specific to each armor type. Some armors can have special protections or effects.

| ----------------- |

## Shield Types
Shields are items that provide passive bonuses to [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi) and [ranged defence](#ranged-defence-agi) and require one free hand to use. This implies they cannot be used at the same time as a two-handed weapon. 

### Buckler
A small, round shield commonly held as far from the body as possible, to deflect small or stabbing weapons with ease. Helps only little against heavy blows, however. And don't expect to deflect arrows with this, either. 

* Bulk: 1

| Defensive Bonus |
| --------------- |
| +1 [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi).  |
| +3 [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi) against **stabbing** attacks. |

If lined with [Ambersteel](#ambersteel), also grants **+1** defence against magic. 

### Round Shield

* Bulk: 2

| --------------- |

| +2 [ranged defence](#melee-defence-agi). |

If lined with [Ambersteel](#ambersteel), also grants **+2** defence against magic. 

### Kite Shield
A large, kite-shaped shield, which can protect every part of the fighter, from the shoulder down to the feet. Its weight makes it difficult to react to attacks quickly, hoever. 

* Bulk: 4
* +1 [exhaustion](#exhaustion) while wielded

| Defensive Bonus |
| --------------- |
| +4 [melee defence](#melee-defence-agi).  |
