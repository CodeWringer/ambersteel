# TODO
* [ ] Invent magic schools
  * [ ] Cryomancy
    * Tire your enemies out
  * [ ] Illusion
    * Create images/sounds/smells that aren't real
    * Better levels allow the influences to hold up better against scrutiny

    * HP recovery
    * Chance of injury treatment
    * Chance of stabilization

# Playtest Questions
* [ ] Is it too easy to defend oneself in combat?
* [ ] Are characters too squishy?
* [ ] Is exhaustion too cumbersome to track?
* [ ] Is combat with multiple opponents too cumbersome to track?
  * [ ] Maybe something like a to-hit-target value could be introduced. Works like DnD AC, is based on melee-/ranged-defence divided by three and rounded up.
