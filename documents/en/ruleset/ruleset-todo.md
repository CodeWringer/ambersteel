# TODO
* [ ] Invent magic schools
  * [ ] Telekinesis
    * Moving things from afar
  * [ ] Telepathy
    * Wordless communication
    * Altering emotions (fear, love, calm, etc.)
    * Issuing compelling commands against another's will
  * [ ] Alteration
    * Shape-shifting
      * Living things tend to mutate horribly
    * Mending broken things, perhaps even living things?
    * Permanently/temporarily changing the shape of things?
  * [ ] Soul-Binding/Necromancy
    * Binding *a* soul to a body with a soul-seal
    * Binding a *specific* soul to a body with a soul-seal
    * Creating command-patterns for a soul-seal
      * This allows for the automatic issuing of commands, like a program of if-then-else statements. 
  * [ ] Hexing
    * Temporary or semi-permanent negative status effects on chosen target(s).
    * Health-bond - two or more targets share the damage or healing done to them. 
* [ ] Somehow make a berserker-build possible. 
  * Perhaps a new skill with berserking skill-abilities?
* [ ] Update semi-random attribute determination

# Playtest Questions
* [ ] Is it too easy to defend oneself in combat?
* [ ] Are characters too squishy?
* [ ] Is exhaustion too cumbersome to track?
* [ ] Is combat with multiple opponents too cumbersome to track?
  * [ ] Maybe something like a to-hit-target value could be introduced. Works like DnD AC, is based on melee-/ranged-defence divided by three and rounded up.
