# Arctic Fenris
The arctic Fenris inhabit the harsher, colder regions of the old world, where there is little civilization and living conditions are harsh. Consequently, they are tough and follow a no-nonsense attitude in everything they do. 

## Personality
They are very reserved toward and sceptical of strangers. They're slow to build trust and prefer keep their distance. This doesn't mean they're complete loners, however. 

They're curious and always on the look-out for new things to discover. For this, they will trek great distances, afforded by their exceptional endurance. 

They are especially territorial and will fiercely defend the land they covet. 

## Social Interactions
Arctic Fenris often form small tight-knit communities, just about large enough to sustain themselves and provide each other security. 

Together, they hunt, explore and fight against intruding tribes and other enemies. 

### Family
While their communities are a tight-knit, children, once old enough to fend for themselves are often banished from the tribe. This is in part to avoid having more mouths to feed than the territory can sustain, but also a natural instinct to keep genetic diversity high. 

Fathers will often leave with their children and join other tribes or even found their own. 

## Music and Art
Arctic Fenris love to sing. It is a great way to distract themselves from the unforgiving cold and the barren, icy landscapes they inhabit. Even when alone, they might hum to themselves as a means to pass the time. 

Not having many materials around, most of their art is limited to simple wood carvings stone sculptures, although both of these are quite rare. 

## Morality and Ethics
Patience and resilience are highly valued traits. 

The strong help themselves, the weak get the left-overs.
