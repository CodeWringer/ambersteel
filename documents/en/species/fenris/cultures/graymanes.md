# Gray-Manes
The most common type of the Fenris, would be those of the Gray-Manes clan. Dotting the many forests of the old world, their villages are fairly plentiful. 

Though possibly superstitions, Gray-Manes often see omens in fairly mundane things. Lightning, rare visitors, magic and so on.
