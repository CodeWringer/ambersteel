# Fenris
Fenris culture varies from tribe to tribe, on an individual level, but, all of them share a general, common culture. 

Central to them, is the belief in spirits of their ancestors, who they worship through totems and communicate with through shamans. 

## Personality
Fenris are generally very active. They love to exert themselves physically and to test their limits. 

They're very curious and open-minded, albeit also a bit naive. And while they wander great distances and love to explore, they're confined to remote locations, where human civilization doesn't reach. Thus, they know precious little about the world, despite what the lore-keeping shamans can pass down between the generations. 

They're wary of strangers, especially humans and are quite territorial. They mark their territory with scratched or painted markings on trees or boulders. 

They like to think of themselves as better than feral wolves and take great exception to comparisons being drawn between them. 

## Social Interactions
In general, Fenris love to interact. They will frequently go on hunts together, craft useful day-to-day items together or dance, play music or howl together. 

### Family
The integrity of the pack is an important aspect of life. The family is an aspect of the pack, but the pack as a whole is seen as family. Therefore, the entire pack helps with raising children, so that they might learn as many skills as possible and be safe from harm. 

### Events
Hunts are perhaps the most common type of event. While the start of a hunt is commonly an unceremonious and down-to-business kind of affair, a successful hunt may result in a small feast to be held. 

Another reason for celebration is the end of winter, when the snow melts and the ice recedes. 

A rare occurrence, is the shamans calling in the pack to convene with their ancestor's spirits. They do this during times of great need or chaos, when they require guidance. 

### Behavioral Norms
Gaining a Fenris' trust is easiest to do, by offering them food or helping them out in a fight. It is not uncommon for Fenris to go on a hunt for big game with strangers, to see if they'll be allies or enemies, when it comes down to it.

Unlike feral wolves, they do not sniff each others behinds to identify each other. As sentient creatures with good eye-sight, they can identify each other visually. If need be, they will sniff around the neck to get a better idea, but it is considered extremely rude to call them butt-sniffers. 

Fenris will often fight for dominant positions in their societies and recognize when an opponent is beaten. Not all fights need to end bloody. 

### Social Status
Every tribe has an alpha male and female. Those who are either the strongest, fastest, wisest or most dexterous can fill that role. To earn that right, one must challenge the current alpha of one's own gender and prove more capable than them. 

Aside from the alphas, the shaman enjoys a very high social status, who even the alphas have a deeply rooted respect for. 

There are also the elders, who are often consulted for guidance by the alphas, when the need isn't great enough to require communion with their ancestors. 

## Fashion
Simple and functional will do for most Fenris. A loincloth, some loose pouches and maybe a cloak for protection against rain, is all most of them need. 

Some wear decorative elements, like feathers or furs, while others carve intricate bracelets or gather shiny rocks to wear around their necks like pearl necklaces. 

## Hygiene
While not obsessed with hygiene, Fenris will groom their fur and prefer dirt to stay out of their coat. 

## Music and Art
Surprisingly, Fenris love music played with instruments. Either acquired from human travelers, or crafted themselves, they play the flute, drums or stringed instruments. 

## Writing
Fenris possess a simple form of written language, consisting of symbols that represent ideas. They use ink or paint to write on tanned, stretched leathers. The skill of reading and writing is generally reserved for the shamans. 

## Cuisine
Nothing special, Fenris mostly eat meat and preferrably cooked, although that is not a necessity. 

## Morality and Ethics
Be good to others, and they will be good to you. Be fair and others will be fair. That stands at the base of Fenris ethics. 

There is also no need for violence for sport, the way humans like to commit. Hunting for sport, for example, is considered a reprehensible behavior. 

## Spirituality
Their belief in their ancestor's spirits watching over them and guiding them is deeply rooted in most Fenris. Offerings of food and furs are placed at the base of elaborately carved totems that represent their ancestors. 

Shamans are believed capable of communicating with the dead. For that, all Fenris of a tribe are called together, to stay by a camp fire, as the shaman utters ancient incantations. Indeed, if successful, spirits may appear in the dancing flames, to provide guidance to their living brethren. But angry spirits may lash out at the shaman and so they make sure to provide offerings frequently. 

Besides their ancestors, they believe in a wolf-like goddess that resides on the moon and looks down upon them. She watches over the ancestors and sends them out on errands. She'll send out ancestor spirits to warn Fenris of impending danger and sends visions of the future to the shamans. She weeps for every Fenris that dies and laments every ancestor coming to her on the moon. 

## World View
Most Fenris know only little of the world beyond their territory. They assume the land stretches on forever, broken up only by large rivers and lakes. Therefore, they consider even the oceans as just very large rivers. 

Clouds are great tufts of the wolf-goddesses fur that came loose. She weeps for those who die and whenever her sorrow grows too great, it falls down on the earth, in the form of rain. 

## Sports and Competition
It is common practice, especially among younger Fenris, to challenge each other during a hunt. They will split up and hunt bigger game, to see who's the best hunter. 

## Names
Last names are usually evocative of an aspect of nature or perhaps chosen in honor of their ancestors.
