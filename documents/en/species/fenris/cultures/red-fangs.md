# Red-Fangs
The red-fangs are quite a bit more morbid. While they're still not friends of needless violence, they revel in strength and power. To project that, they wear simple armors made of bone, or will wear necklaces of teeth and bone and place bone effigies. 

They'll also commonly paint their fur coat in red paint, reminiscent of the bloody spectacle of a successful hunt. 

It is not uncommon for them to intrude on the territory of other tribes or species, as a means of provocation. They wish to test themselves and their strength. Should they remain unchallenged, they'll usually move on, without causing too much trouble.
