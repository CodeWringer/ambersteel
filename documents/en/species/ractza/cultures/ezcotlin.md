# Ezcotlin
The Ezcotlin live localized to the north of the [new world](../../../world/world). 

## Personality
Isolationist in nature, they're skeptical of outsiders and not used to guests. Slow to build trust, once they've warmed up to strangers, they'll treat them like family. 

Aside from that, they're generally very patient and resolute. 

Inside their communities, relations are close and they'll help each other eagerly. They're very guarded towards outsiders and slow to build trust. 

## Social Interactions

### Family
Siblings have a naturally positive disposition towards each other and Ezcotlin highly value their parents. 

Renowned and capable males are allowed to breed, as the chieftains and shamans are usually Zilkeans and thus hold the privilege of choosing who to mate with. 

If there are more Zilkeans in a tribe, they're kept on a close leash by the chieftain. They're revered by the males and treated with the utmost respect, but they're also not allowed to roam freely or to mingle with the males on their own accord. 

### Events

### Behavioral Norms
Gifts of food are a common way to introduce oneself to a stranger one wants to get on good terms with. 

It is customary for shamans to be gifted strangely shaped bones they can use in divinations. 

Chieftains have an inherent right to the tastiest food and warmest furs. 

Zilkeans are treated with great respect, regardless of their relation to one's own lineage. 

### Social Status
Social status is very much a matter of rank within the tribe. Responsibility and birth factor into that. Shamans provide spiritual guidance, their chieftains lead the tribes, great hunters provide food and crafters create invaluable tools. 

## Fashion
Thick furs and fur coats are worn by the Ezcotlin. 

They prefer dyeing the insides of their coats with warm colors that contrast their barren home's landscape. 

## Hygiene
They do value personal hygiene greatly and tribes will often fight over hot springs they use as natural baths. Hot springs are also often seen as holy sites, where gods touched the earth and blessed the frozen soil. 

## Music and Art
Drums and hollowed animal horns are commonly part of ceremonies and festive occasions. 

Wood carvings that depict great chieftains and shamans, as well as events of history or divinations. 

## Writing
Their shamans have some knowledge of writing, mostly based on the writing the [high Rac'tza](high-ractza) use. The medium of choice is tanned animal leathers, sometimes in the form of parchment. 

## Cuisine
Ezcotlin aren't known for their cuisine. However, due to the low availability of food up north, they've developed many forms of food preservation that their southern brethren might not even know about. 

For food storage, they commonly use burned clay pots, which they produce closer to the south, where unfrozen water, clay and dry wood can be found more readily. This often causes conflicts to arise with the [high Rac'tza](high-ractza) that control those regions. 

## Morality and Ethics
Ezcotlin are highly religious creatures. Their shamans hold great sway within a tribe and it has been known that sometimes shamans even rose up against their chieftains, claiming control. 

## Spirituality
Ezcotlin believe in several gods. Some are major and some minor deities, each with varying levels of influence over Rac'tza lives. 

They consider their gods all-knowing and quite interested in the daily affairs of their servants. 

## World View
Beyond their shores, there is nothing. An endless sea stretches out before them. 

## Sports and Competition
Ezcotlin like to compete in hunting. Sometimes solo hunts, other times in groups. Those who bring back the biggest game earn greater reputation and particularly large game can cause a feast to be held in their honor.
