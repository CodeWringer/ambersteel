# Broodlisk
The Broodlisk are universally hated among the other tribes of Rac'tza. Looking at their primary diet, one can see why. They will eat anything that isn't another Broodlisk, including other kinds of Rac'tza. The Broodlisk have split off from the other Rac'tza a long time ago and have moved to the swamps, where they placed traps. Not only to catch wild animals, but also other Rac'tza. 

## Personality
Broodlisk are inherently twitchy and nervous, constantly on the look-out for enemies, of which they have many. 



## Social Interactions

### Family
A concept of family is foreign to them. Eggs are laid and forgotten about. Those that hatch, must struggle to survive and earn a place in the tribe or else be exiled. 

Broodlisks do not trust or care for each other particularly, not even their off-spring. 

### Events
Defeating other Rac'tza tribes always promises one thing - a feast. The feasts are pretty much the only time when Broodlisks come together and almost seem *merry*, comparatively speaking. 

### Behavioral Norms

### Social Status
Corpulence may be the single most defining factor to display and enjoy a higher social status as a Broodlisk. The more well-rounded you are, the better a hunter and more respectable you are. 

Unlike other Rac'tza, the Broodlisk's Zilkeans do not enjoy any higher social status. In fact, they are rarely treated well. The plentiful males only see them as *fun diversions*, which just so *happen* to produce off-spring. Zilkeans are expected to be *receptive* all of the time. If they're not, it simply makes it less *fun*. 

## Fashion
Broodlisks are actually quite creative when it comes to working with bones, a material they -for obvious reasons- have an abundance of. They create quite a wide array of different accessories and even armors out of bone. Each more grotesque and terrifying than the last. 

## Hygiene
This word really holds no meaning to them. They live in swamps and murky waters, ditches filled with mud and any other haven of bacteria. 

Seeing as they needn't fear microscopic enemies, due to their blood, it is understandable they pay no heed to how much dirt they're covered in. 

## Music and Art
As one might expect, both their music and art are crude and brutish. Drums announce war and they announce feasts. Bone and skin effigies dot their camps, in cruel mockery of those they represent. 

## Cuisine
There isn't much cuisine to speak of. It's mostly meat, and if it has a funny taste, you might not want to ask what -or who- you're having. 

## Morality and Ethics
Morality, as we know it, has very little meaning to Broodlisk. On the other hand, they are very pragmatic and won't kill, unless it's at the promise of a meal. 

Unlike what one might expect, Broodlisks aren't evil creatures. They won't torture, for one, as it simply doesn't provide them any benefits. One may instead compare them to highly aggressive predatorial animals. They will hunt when they're hungry and fight when they're bored, but there is almost never an air of malevolence. 

## Sports and Competition
Broodlisks will fight, a lot, just for fun. These fights may well end bloody, but rarely deadly.
