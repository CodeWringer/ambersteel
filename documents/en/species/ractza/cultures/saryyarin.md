# Saryyarin
The oddest of the Rac'tza, the Saryyarin are the underground-based lizardmen, who live in several underground temple-cities that they carved deep into the mountains. 

## Personality
Saryyarin are often somewhat grouchy and grumpy, but they're also honest and sincere. 

They're far less chatty than their brethren above the surface, mostly toiling away in the darkness in silence. They prefer to speak only when they have something meaningful to say. 

Outsiders are regarded with suspicion, but they're fairly quick to build trust, provided one is honest and sincere in their interactions with them. 

They regard the surface world with suspicion, thinking it some land of chaos and absence of structure and security. 

## Social Interactions

### Family
Family is highly valued and parents and siblings are respected. 

Unlike other Rac'tza, Zilkeans aren't particularly privileged, although they're still treated with great respect. Thus, mating can occur more freely. Thus, there are no common spawnings, the way other Rac'tza know it. 

### Events
#### Dance of Glass
A bi-annual event, where gifts of gems and gem-encrusted jewelry are made by males in attempts to woo Zilkeans. 

These events are held in the large meeting halls, where large luminescent crystal lights flood the space with a rainbow of light. 

### Behavioral Norms

### Social Status
Zilkeans generally enjoy a highr social standing. And males that Zilkeans accept as mates also gain better social standing. 

Aside from that, social standing is tied to the clan one's a member of. Clans are often mixed in terms of professions fulfilled by its members. A clan's great achievements elevates all its members and every member contributes towards their clan's renown. 

## Fashion
Saryyarin love shiny metals and glittering gemstones. They wear ample jewelry, most of all the Zilkeans, who are often covered head to toe in gold, silver and gems. 

Aside from the abundance of valuables, they cover their bodies in cloth and furs, as a means of keeping warm in the damp underground tunnels they inhabit. 

## Hygiene
Hygiene doesn't hold a particular value for them, as they often go weeks without bathing. It is more common for the Zilkeans to bathe more often. 

## Music and Art


## Writing
The scholars within Saryyarin societies are literate and inscribe many things on light stone tablets. Large library halls are filled to the brim with tablets, holding knowledge pertaining to all the various aspects of Saryyarin life. Each library is curated by a Zilkean and their clan. 

## Cuisine
Saryyarin cuisine is often very spartan, consisting only of what food they can acquire or cultivate in the dark. 

Many of the mushrooms they grow are an aquired taste and the animals they hunt or domesticate are tough and their meat chewy. 

## Morality and Ethics
They dislike pointless violence, slavery and unwarranted arrogance as they perceive within [high Rac'tza](high-ractza) societies. 

## Spirituality
Even the underground dwelling Saryyarin believe in the gods' influence on the world, but they feel their connection is weaker the deeper they go. As such, they construct temples as close to the surface as possible, to get the strongest connection to the heavens. 

Some Saryyarin, although in secret and not officially endorsed, believe in gods from below and seek to go deeper into the earth's crust, where they believe the true gods to reside. After all, the beauty hidden in the earth must come from somewhere and was put there to be found by the Saryyarin, not the haughty [high Rac'tza](high-ractza) or the freaky warm-blooded [Ezcotlin](Ezcotlin). 

## World View
There is little beyond the mountains they reside in, or at least, little of worth. Instead, the earth presents itself as an endless space for the Saryyarin to inhabit. 

When it rains above ground, they believe the world to have twisted and they fear the oceans to drown the world. The underground is safe and can be locked off and no tidal waves can sweep its inhabitants away. 

## Sports and Competition
Most competition is based on craftsmanship.
