# Urshar
The Urshar represent the fighter-caste beasts of burden of the Rac'tza. 

## Origin and Presence
Urshar aren't very common and bred specifically for war. 

## Physical Traits
Large, muscular and brutish, the Urshar are not the thinker-types. Their thick scales are the toughest of all lizardmen and their pain-tolerance high, allowing them to simply shrug pain. 

Despite their size and rigid scales, they are deceptively fast and agile, when they need to be. 

Their lower intelligence results in characteristically simple and slower speech, compared to the other Rac'tza. 

### Appearance
They are very large, becoming up to 2,5 meters tall and have a very broad frame, packed with strong muscles and tough scales. 

### Lifecycle
The Urshar only reach a maximum age of about 50 years. 

## Magic
Urshar have no magical ability whatsoever. In fact, they revere and fear magic-users.
