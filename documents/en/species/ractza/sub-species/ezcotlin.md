# Ezcotlin
The Ezcotlin are a race of humanoid lizards, that, unlike other lizard-kind, are warmblooded. 

## Origin and Presence
Having originated within the ranks of the Rac'tza, a few millenia ago, the Ezcotlin have since developed in a completely different direction. Several religious and ethical disputes with their former family have forced them north, where they live in relative isolation and peace. 

## Physical Traits
Ezcotlin are warm-blooded, a unique trait and most unusual for lizardmen. This allows them to live in relative isolation in the cold north, where the days are short and the nights cold. 

To further insulate them from the cold, they've developed fur which mostly covers their back, head and shoulders, with a mane covering the neck. 

### Appearance
Their skin can vary from dull to radiant red, orange or yellow.
