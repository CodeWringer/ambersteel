# Broodlisk
An ancient off-shoot from the High-Rac'tza, the Broodlisk represent an odd member of the family. 

## Origin and Presence
Their origin lies in the High Rac'tza, who never delved far beyond their grand sun-bathed cities, whereas the Broodlisk dared venture beyond. The cultural conflict that ensued drove them out of the cities and into the swamps and darkest reaches of the jungles, where they now remain. 

## Physical Traits
Broodlisks are noticeably larger than their brethren. This awards them greater strength, at the expense of grace. 

Their skin can adapt to their immediate surroundings, allowing them an excellent degree of camouflage, especially in the swampy and murky waters they call home. This, paired with near limitless patience render them outstanding ambush-hunters. 

What's more, Broodlisk blood is poisonous, even to their own kind. This is their evolutionary mechanism to guard them against self-destructive cannibalism. 

Broodlisk Zilkeans are much shorter than the others of their kind. They also do not possess the same kind of sharp wit, or they may simply not get to express it much among the company of brutes. On the other hand, they're far more numerous than among other Rac'tza-kind, with one Zilkean being born for every 2 to 3 males. 

### Diet
Broodlisks are predominantly cannibalistic and carnivorous. They may be able to digest something other than meat, but they'd rather starve than find out. 

### Appearance
Broodlisks appear far more brutish than the other kinds of Rac'tza. They lack the intelligent gaze or elegance of movement the others of their kind possess. 

Their skin is very well suited to their environments, however, and they can even adapt their skin color to their immediate surroundings, given a few minutes of sitting still to adapt. 

### Lifecycle
Perhaps due to their unhealthy lifestyle, or some magical influence, Broodlisks tend to lead very short lives, succumbing to their own poisonous blood past the age of 40. 

And if their own blood doesn't kill them, then the plentiful other danges of the swamps will. 

## Magic
Lacking the wit and self-control of their brethren, it is fairly rare to encounter a Broodlisk showing any kind of magical gift, whether they have it or not.
