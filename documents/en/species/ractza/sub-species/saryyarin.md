# Saryyarin
A race of humanoid lizards, cold-blooded and covered in scales. 

## Origin and Presence
The Saryyarin may have split off the Rac'tza, much like the Ezcotlin, but a much longer time ago. 

They prefer living unerground, in large caverns, either natural or hand carved. 

## Physical Traits
They are much shorter than other lizardfolk, but also much stouter and sturdier. 

Their adaptance to the underground has granted them great sight in bad lighting conditions, as well as a keen sense of hearing that they use to navigate complete darkness. 

### Appearance
Their skin is mostly pale and a gray or blue hue. Their snouts are much shorter and *sharper* looking than those of [high Rac'tza](high-ractza). 

Their tails are much shorter and tend to have a lot of tension in them, to help the Saryyarin better keep their balance.
