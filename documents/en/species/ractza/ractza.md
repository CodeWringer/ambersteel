# Rac'tza
The Rac'tza are a folk of humanoid lizards. 

There are the following three kinds of Rac'tza breeds within each of the families of Rac'tza: 
* [Rin'nin](sub-species/general/rinnin)
* [Urshar](sub-species/general/urshar)
* [Zilkean](sub-species/general/zilkean)

In terms of overarching genotypes, there are four families of Rac'tza:
* [High Rac'tza](sub-species/high-ractza)
* [Ezcotlin](sub-species/Ezcotlin)
* [Saryyarin](sub-species/saryyarin)
* [Broodlisk](sub-species/broodlisk)

## Origin and presence
They are present all throughout the [new world](../../world/world). 

## Physical Traits
Their scaly skin protects them both from harm and the elements. 

A long tail helps them keep balance. 

### Diet 
All Rac'tza enjoy a meat heavy diet, including smaller and larger insects and occasionally fruit. 

Most vegetables don't agree well with them, however. 

### Lifecycle
As reptilians, they lay eggs, from which, after a few weeks, new Rac'tza hatch. The eggs are kept in special temple buildings, usually in heated baths where the temperature for the hatchlings is being kept ideal. 

The Zilkeans are the only females within the species. Due to their lower numbers, the reproduction rate for the Rac'tza is also fairly low, although each spawning sees a large number of new Rac'tza hatching. 

## Magic
Practically all Zilkeans are inherently highly magically attuned, whereas only some Rin'nin are and none of the Urshar possess any magical ability.
