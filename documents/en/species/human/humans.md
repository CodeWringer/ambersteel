# Humans
Humans represent the largest slice of the population in the old world. They are adaptable and resilient, with great capacity for both compassion and hate. 

## Origin and Presence
Humanity has been on the old world for a long time, presenting its dominant race throughout history. Humans are diverse and adaptable, inhabiting almost every corner of the old world. 

## Physical Traits
Generally very adaptable, smart, dexterous and comparatively strong, humans have all the traits necessary to render them the dominant species of the old world. 

That is not to say there aren't stronger, more dexterous or even smarter creatures out there, but humans are the ones most used to the struggle for survival. Whenever there is an advantage to be exploited, humanity won't wait long to do so. 

### Diet
One would be hard-pressed to find anything that humans can't eat outright or prepare in such a way as to make it edible, aside from downright toxic foods. 

### Appearance
Humans are very diverse, just as they are in the real world. They are up to 2 meters tall. 

Darker skin colors prevail in the southern regions of the old world, whereas in the east, skin colors are lighter, with a very light brown-yellowish hue. Most other regions have mostly white skinned people. 

Obviously, these are only general rules of thumb, instead of absolutes. 

### Lifecycle
Humans multiply fairly quickly, all throughout the year. They live up to around 70 years old, although that usually depends on social and financial status. 

## Magic
Only few humans are born with the ability to channel the winds of magic in order to cast spells.
