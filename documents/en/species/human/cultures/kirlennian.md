# Kirlennian
Kirlennians are very proud, patriotic and martially inclined people. 

Due to their isolationism they have grown deeply distrustful of foreigners and strangers. They will not open up to foreigners and strangers or relax around them, instead always staying on edge, seeing them as potential threats. 

However, they're very open towards fellow Kirlennians. Amongst each other, they are very sociable and help each other without question. 

Kirlennians are very loyal people. Loyal to their emperor, loyal to each other and to their friends. 






## Personality
It is not impossible to gain a Kirlennian's trust, and those that do, will quickly learn they could not find a more loyal and trusting friend. 

They love to sing and dance, play music and drink in company. 

There is a strong sense of superiority emanating from many Kirlennians, as they believe themselves to be the rightful inheritors of the world. 

## Social Interactions
Social status is divided into social class and martial prowess. 
Within the social classes of peasantry, craftsmen, nobility and even royalty, martial prowess and military honor also increase one's social status. 

All Kirlennians strive to distinguish themselves as great fighters and will seek plenty of opportunities to do so. As important as personal glory, is the renown of the unit one served or serves under in war. The achievements of the unit reflect positively upon the individual member. As such, Kirlennians take great pride in their unit. The battle standard, the officer's names and the names of the great battles they participated in are treasured pieces of information to every Kirlennian. 

As a favored weapon of choice, wealthy Kirlennians will choose the long sword, as it is considered the most elegant weapon of all. They will proudly wear their long sword in decorated sheath hanging from their belt. 

### Family

### Events

### Behavioral Norms
It is considered very rude to haggle. Kirlennians trust each other to name fair prices.

When meeting strangers, it is common practice to do a military salute. Familiar faces are instead met with a bear-hug. 

### Social Status

## Fashion
It is considered most fashionable to wear the colors of the nation, especially if it covers one's armor. 

Hats and jewelry are generally seen as expensive, useless and cumbersome. Medals and sigils on the other hand are proudly worn. 

## Hygiene
Kirlennians don't pay particular heed to hygiene, although they certainly don't enjoy being smelly and filthy, either. But they follow a more pragmatic approach. Having a full bath takes time and resources, thus should be done when there is an abundance of both. Otherwise, most Kirlennians are contend with washing just their face and hands.
