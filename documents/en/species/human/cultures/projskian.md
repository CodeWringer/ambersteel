# Projskian
Projskian culture has not really spread far beyond the borders of the [Projskian Kijserreik]() and is a very distinguishing mark of most Projskians. Surprising is the fact that much like [Svessians](svessian), they stem from [The Old Empire](../../../nations/historical/human/old-empire), yet have taken a unique direction, compared to their neighbors. 

## Personality
* Proud, determined and authoritative, yet respectful and polite. 
* Guarded and ever-skeptical.
* Rational and distant, or so they think. 
* Many Projskians take great pride in their work and enjoy showing off their great works. 
* Sciences and knowledge enjoy great esteem.  

## Social Interactions
Aside from spending much time at the baths, many projskians spend their free time shopping or having a good time at the plentiful taverns and inns or being more sensible and reading at the library. 

Also popular are reading clubs, grand balls, theatre and circuses, tournaments and feasts. 

### Family
Most family relations are distanced, with an acknowledgement and appreciation within the family, but without particular value placed on it. 

Parents support their children as best they can and thier children return the favor with gifts and monthly payments. Both parties understand this as an unspoken agreement, almost like a business contract. 

Both parents are involved in raising their child, at an intensity depending on who's the primary source of income. 

### Events
#### Coronation Day
Once a year, on the day of their current Kijser's coronation, all non-essential work is paused and the masses gather at the great square in front of the Kijser's palace, to hear the Kijser speak. The Kijser is expected to hold a speech, the topic of which is their choosing, but should be related to the Kijserreik's achievements, current hardships and its people. 

After the speech, taverns are filled to the brim and street vendors serve drinks, as guests and customers drink to the health of their Kijser. 

#### Liberation Day
Every year, great festivals and feasts are held, celebrating the day the [Amberite Kijser](../../../characters/amberite-Kijser) freed the old world and founded the Kijserreik. 

### Behavioral Norms
Littering and vandalism is a clear sign of depravity and not to be done. 

Haggling is considered rude. 

### Social Status
Many Projskians are merchants, scholars, professional soldiers or craftsmen. 

Social status is proudly worn in the form of expensive and exquisite looking clothes and jewelry, or as ornaments in their arms and armor. 

Aside from the worn wealth, many buildings also represent their owner's wealth and status, as they are often times decorated with artful trims, statues and sculptures. 

## Fashion
Projskians love to wear elegant and expensive clothes, but the hats especially are where Projskians distinguish themselves. 

There are many shapes of hat and often times decorations sewn directly into the cloth, showcasing a family crest or perhaps some symbol of wealth, honor or wisdom. 

Men often times wear a colorful doublet and a just as colorful coat over it. 
Contradicting the colorful torso, are mostly simple, dull shoes and boots, which act as a balance to the otherwise very colorful garments. 

Especially professional soldiers enjoy wearing clothes with a military and formal aspect to them, with insignias of their company or perhaps earned medals sewn in. 

## Hygiene
Projskians pay great heed to the hygienic conditions of their environment. They will pour their trash and filth into the gully, where it swiftly enters the sewer system and is swept out of the city. 

Also, Projskians love the baths. Cleanliness is considered to keep both body and mind healthy. The water in the bath-houses is exchanged regularly and fresh water boiled before being poured into the baths. This happens about once every month and many Projskians look forward to their visit just after the water has been changed. 

Many Projskians keep a bowl of fresh water in the entrance hall to their homes, where visitors and servants alike are expected to wash their hands before proceeding further into the house. 

## Music and Art
Music and art is at an all-time high. Stringed instruments, wind instruments and other "finer" music find great popularity. Paintings and sculptures are common place. 

## Literacy
Projskians care a lot about whether one can read and write. It is considered a basic ability to read, while writing may not necessarily be seen as such. 

Often times, how civilized a nation is, is measured by their literary works and how many of their people can read and write. 

## Cuisine
Fairly typical to the projskian cuisine is the heavy reliance on potatoes, which are part of many dishes. No matter which tavern you enter, you can rely on loving preparation of the many potato-based dishes. 

Aside from that, one can expect a wide variety of foods and spices to be served in many places, although dishes tend to get simpler the further one distances themselves from the urban centers. 

## Morality and Ethics

## Spirituality
There aren't many religious Projskians, although there is a strong sympathy towards [Amberantism](../../../religions/amberantism) and [Amelianism](../../../religions/amelianism). 

## World View
Most Projskians suspect the world may actually be curved, but haven't quite committed to that idea yet. 

The firmament is still considered some kind of tapestry looming overhead, rotating as the day goes by. 

## Sports and Competition
### The Great Battle
A ceremonial recreation of the great battle, at the palace of the god-mage of The [Old Empire](../../../nations/historical/human/old-empire), where the [Amberite Kijser](../../../characters/amberite-Kijser) triumphed and announced the foundation of the Kijserreik. 

A hundred warriors gather on the Kijser palace's plaza, where a large tournament is held. Each wears intricate parade armor, decorated with bands of gold, emblazoned with gem stones and engraved with heavily decorated letters spelling their family name. 

The event begins with the battle itself, where the contestants are split into several groups, each representing a unit of the battle. Each group has one standard-bearer and the goal of each side is to capture as many of the other side's banners, before the alotted time runs out. Whichever side has the most banners by the end of it, wins and its members then go on to the individual competitions, while the other side are eliminated from the tournament. There is no actual bloody battle. Warriors may only wield blunted weapons and must either wrestle their opponents to the ground or disarm them, to render them defeated. A defeated warrior must remain kneeled at the place they "fall". Appointed referees ensure the rules are followed at all times. 

It is a great ceremony that even the Kijser himself attends. It is held only once every three years, due to the immense preparation work and special meaning that goes into it.
