# Projskian
Projskians are very orderly, with a great passion for law, order and tidiness. They're also very strict and prideful. As such, social interactions are fairly cold, even if repectful and polite, even among their families. 

Most Projskians are constantly looking for self-improvement. The sciences, art and philosophy are very popular, while religion is viewed with great scepticism. What matters is not one's birth, but one's achievements and hard work. 

They're a vain and proud people, but with the skills and diligence to support such an aspect. 

Projskian culture has not really spread far beyond the borders of the [Projskian Kijserreik](../../../nations/human/projskian-kijserrijk/projskian-kijserrijk.md) and is a very distinguishing mark of most Projskians. Surprising is the fact that much like [Svessians](svessian), they stem from [The Old Empire](../../../nations/historical/human/old-empire), yet have taken a unique direction, compared to their neighbors.

## Appearance
* Brown-reddish or blonde hair common
* Many blue and green eyes
* Tall people are common
* Many are fairly slim, not very broad-shouldered

### Body Adornment
* Projskians don't typically practice body painting or scarification. Such practices are considered barbaric. 
* Women often wear plenty of jewelry. Rings, ear rings, bracelets, necklaces, etc. 
* Men tend to only wear rings. 

### Clothing & Fashion
* Projskians love to wear elegant and expensive clothes. 
* Especially the hats are where Projskians distinguish themselves. 
  * There are many shapes of hat and often times decorations sewn directly into the cloth, showcasing a family crest or perhaps some symbol of wealth, honor or wisdom. 
* Men often times wear a colorful doublet and a just as colorful coat over it. Contradicting the colorful torso, are mostly simple, dull shoes and boots, which act as a balance to the otherwise very colorful garments. 
* Women tend to wear fashionable dresses and plenty of jewelry, flaunting their success with every wave of the hand. 
* Variety is key among Projskians. The wealthy enjoy burgeoning wardrobes, full of mundane and exotic, colorful and dull clothes, for every occasion. The poor try to keep up, but usually stick to the same few dyed shirts. 
* Fashion inertia is great. Most Projskians don't particularly care for the current fashions in other countries. 
* That isn't to say Projskians aren't vain. Their perception of what is fashionable simply doesn't change often. 
* Especially professional soldiers enjoy wearing clothes with a military and formal aspect to them, with insignias of their company or perhaps their earned medals sewn in their garments. 

## Family
* The rules within a family are usually made by whoever is responsible for most of the income. 
### Among the wealthy...
* Mostly just the immediate parents and siblings are considered family. Distant cousins or grandparents don't enjoy particular value. 
* Most family relations are distanced, with an acknowledgement and appreciation within the family, but without particular value placed on it. 
* Parents support their children as best they can and thier children return the favor with gifts or monthly payments. Both parties understand this as an unspoken agreement, almost like a business contract. 
### Among the poor...
* Families can be quite extended and often live together in the same household.
* Even among the poor, familial relations are somewhat cold, almost business-like. They understand themselves as stronger together, which is why they stick together, but in actuality, they wish to live like the wealthy. 

### Houshold
#### Among the wealthy...
* Most households consist of the master family as well as up to two dozen servants, depending on the wealthiness of the masters. 
* It is uncommon for children to remain in their parents' home once they've come of age. It is expected they venture forth and found their own family and fortune.
* Grandparents are expected to take care of themselves (or by their servants, in actuality).
#### Among the poor...
* Most households consist of the entire family. 
* Most of the outdoors labor is assigned to the younger family members, while the elders clean the home, cook the food, raise the children, etc. 

### Marriage
* One may have only one spouse. 
* Divorce is possible, although strictly regulated. Most Projskians prefer to be sure of the "quality" of their spouse, before asking for marriage. 
* Marriage is primarily a civil institution. State officials take care of the bureaucratic procedures. 

### Childcare
* Children are encouraged to pick up whatever profession they like, as long as they strive hard for success. 
* Orphans must rely on state institutions or their distant family to take them in. The older the child, the more likely it will be taken in, because it won't cost as much over time. 

### Domestic Violence
* Domestic violence is uncommon and considered a crime. 

## Customs and Social Life
* Violent fights are considered barbaric and uncivil. The courts are where Projskians carry out their vendettas. 
* Most Projskians are very politically active and quite interested in the activities of their government. 

### Class and Hierarchy
* The class divisions are fluent. The only thing stopping social mobility is wealth and commercial success. 
* There is a substantial middle class of wealthy craftsmen and successful merchants, that is constantly growing, albeit slowly. A small portion are nobility, another substantial professional soldiers and the remaining, large chunk are the lower class - servants and peasants. 

### Healing Arts
* Doctors and medicuses are respectable professions and people visit them without hesitation, when necessary. 
* Deformities don't matter, as long as the affected doesn't let it get in their way. 

### Manners
* Projskians pay great heed to proper manners and professional politeness. Failing in this discipline can result in soured negotiations and denial of hospitality. 

#### Greetings
* A proper greeting is a proper handshake. Among soldiers, a salute is preferred. 
* Wealthy Projskians enjoy when those they meet know of and mention their great achievements to them. Polite flattery goes down well. 
* Nobility must be adressed and will be referred to with their full title. 

#### Gestures & Body Language
* Gestures and body language are generally subtle. It is considered vulgar to flail wildly with one's arms. 

#### Visiting & Hospitality
* Projskian hospitality is as reserved as one would expect. Unexpected guests are unwelcome, while expected visitors may experience much warmer treatment. 
* Food and drink are only offered to respected guests. Quality and quantity depend on the length and importance of the visit. 
* Guests stay in their own bedroom overnight. Even among the poor, a separate sleeping space will be cleared out for the guest. 
* Many Projskians keep a bowl of fresh water in the entrance hall to their homes, where visitors and servants alike are expected to wash their hands before proceeding further into the house. 

#### Tabus & Faux Pas
* Belittling the grandeur of their nation generally results in negative responses and poor treatment. 
* It is a tabu to talk about private matters openly. 
* Projskians are fairly prude.

## Social Interactions
Aside from spending much time at the baths, many projskians spend their free time shopping or having a good time at the plentiful taverns and inns or being more sensible and reading at the library. 

Also popular are reading clubs, grand balls, theatre and circuses, tournaments and feasts. 

### Events
#### Coronation Day
Once a year, on the day of their current Kijser's coronation, all non-essential work is paused and the masses gather at the great square in front of the Kijser's palace, to hear the Kijser speak. The Kijser is expected to hold a speech, the topic of which is their choosing, but should be related to the Kijserreik's achievements, current hardships and its people. 

After the speech, taverns are filled to the brim and street vendors serve drinks, as guests and customers drink to the health of their Kijser. 

#### Liberation Day
Every year, great festivals and feasts are held, celebrating the day the [Amberite Kijser](../../../characters/amberite-Kijser) freed the old world and founded the Kijserreik. 

### Behavioral Norms
Littering and vandalism is a clear sign of depravity and not to be done. 

Haggling is considered rude. 

### Social Status
Many Projskians are merchants, scholars, professional soldiers or craftsmen. 

Social status is proudly worn in the form of expensive and exquisite looking clothes and jewelry, or as ornaments in their arms and armor. 

Aside from the worn wealth, many buildings also represent their owner's wealth and status, as they are often times decorated with artful trims, statues and sculptures. 

## Music and Art
Music and art is at an all-time high. Stringed instruments, wind instruments and other "finer" music find great popularity. Paintings and sculptures are common place. 

## Literacy
Projskians care a lot about whether one can read and write. It is considered a basic ability to read, while writing may not necessarily be seen as such. 

Often times, how civilized a nation is, is measured by their literary works and how many of their people can read and write. 

## Cuisine
Fairly typical to the projskian cuisine is the heavy reliance on potatoes, which are part of many dishes. No matter which tavern you enter, you can rely on loving preparation of the many potato-based dishes. 

Aside from that, one can expect a wide variety of foods and spices to be served in many places, although dishes tend to get simpler the further one distances themselves from the urban centers. 

## Morality and Ethics

## Spirituality
There aren't many religious Projskians, although there is a strong sympathy towards [Amberantism](../../../religions/amberantism) and [Amelianism](../../../religions/amelianism). 

## World View
Most Projskians suspect the world may actually be curved, but haven't quite committed to that idea yet. 

The firmament is still considered some kind of tapestry looming overhead, rotating as the day goes by. 

## Sports and Competition
### The Great Battle
A ceremonial recreation of the great battle, at the palace of the god-mage of The [Old Empire](../../../nations/historical/human/old-empire), where the [Amberite Kijser](../../../characters/amberite-Kijser) triumphed and announced the foundation of the Kijserreik. 

A hundred warriors gather on the Kijser palace's plaza, where a large tournament is held. Each wears intricate parade armor, decorated with bands of gold, emblazoned with gem stones and engraved with heavily decorated letters spelling their family name. 

The event begins with the battle itself, where the contestants are split into several groups, each representing a unit of the battle. Each group has one standard-bearer and the goal of each side is to capture as many of the other side's banners, before the alotted time runs out. Whichever side has the most banners by the end of it, wins and its members then go on to the individual competitions, while the other side are eliminated from the tournament. There is no actual bloody battle. Warriors may only wield blunted weapons and must either wrestle their opponents to the ground or disarm them, to render them defeated. A defeated warrior must remain kneeled at the place they "fall". Appointed referees ensure the rules are followed at all times. 

It is a great ceremony that even the Kijser himself attends. It is held only once every three years, due to the immense preparation work and special meaning that goes into it.
