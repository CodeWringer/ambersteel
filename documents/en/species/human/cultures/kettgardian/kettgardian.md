# Kettgardian
Kettgardians are very stout and stubborn folk, who bow to no one. Proudly, they repel invaders as one, yet squabble amongst each other over petty disputes. 

They're rough folk. Domestic violence is common, so are inequality and bigotry. The nobility are generally to blame for it all. They live in the tallest spires of the great fortresses, while the poor toil in the treacherous mines or arid fields. 

Kettgardians are also a very pragmatic folk. Both in costume and mannerisms, they prefer functional and to the point over ornate and roundabout. 

The honor of the family reflects upon the individual, and vice-versa. As such, family clans are very tight-knit communities and alliances between houses carefully crafted through marriages. Being very patriarchical, the lord of the house enjoys the utmost respect. Failing to pay sufficient homage to the lord can start wars. 

Where others see a treacherous mountain range, Kettgardians see a fine place for a sprawling city. And it will be so, until proven otherwise. Considering Kettgardian stubbornness, that would take quite some convincing, too. 

Wary of strangers, they're not known for their welcoming nature. In fact, even [Amberantists](../../../../independent-organizations/amber-order.md) have a difficult time on Kettgardian lands, despite Kettgardian disdain of magic - a mutual trait.

* Brown and green eyes
* White skin

### Body Adornment
* Many full beards
* Many very long and even braided beards
* Men usually shave their heads
* Short and styled mustaches are reserved for the nobility. They consider commoners with such facial hair arrogant and pretentious. 

### Clothing & Fashion

* Hats are typically simple and functional. 
  * More men than women tend to wear hats. 
* Carrying one's arms along is commonplace. 
* Plump women are considered good-looking and healthy. 

## Family
* Kettgardian families can be quite extended, with distant cousins being considered "close family".
* Pride in one's heritage runs deep. The achievements of the house reflect upon the individual, and vice-versa. 

### Houshold
* Most families tend to own a house and most of the family lives nearby, sometimes in the same street. 
* A typical household is made up of grandparents, parents and children. 
* Servants are reserved for the nobility and are usually slaves. 
* Women tend to stay at home and perform "womanly duties". 

### Marriage
* One spouse. 
* The parents arrange marriages. 
* Divorce isn't officially supported. The disgrace of a divorce would be great. 
* Marriage is a matter of utility. Alliances are forged through blood. 
* Kettgardians are not tolerant of deviant sexual behavior. Homosexuality suffers a bad name. 

### Childcare

* Girls are taught household skills. 
* Teaching methods are strict, with violence and threats of violence a common methodology to make children compliant.

### Manners

* Gifts are rude - they imply weakness. But fulfillment of requests is perfectly fine.

#### Greetings
* Greeting someone with the name of their house can go a long way to endearing yourself to them.

* Kettgardians dislike guests wandering around their home and property freely. They'll keep a watchful eye at all times.
