# Arnshyran
Most Arnshyrans have their home in the west of the [old world](../../../world/world), occupying [Arn](../../../world/arn/arn) and most parts of the northern coast of the [old world](../../../world/world).

## Personality
* Arnshyrans are hardy, stout and simple folk. 
* They value strength and endurance. They have little sympathy for weaklings. 
* They're very fearful of their gods and very pious

## Social Interactions
Social interaction is usually only tolerable if alcoholic beverages are involved. Raiders stick together, much like families, but once their business together is concluded, they scatter. 

### Family
Most fathers prefer being tough and harsh, dominating the family and leaving little room for their wife to interfere. It is important to uphold the honor of the family, through whatever means necessary. A father's primary concern is always the strength of their sons, to ensure the security of the family. 

Despite that, sons feel the obligation to honor the blood-ties, but foster a cold relationship to their father, while they feel they barely know their mother. 

Daughters are commonly married off to create alliances by extending the family. Blood ties are important and secure peace. 

### Events
#### Raid
Arnshyrans often organize raids, sailing along the coastlines, to where they suspect weak settlements and then landing to plunder and murder with impunity.

### Behavioral Norms

### Social Status
Wealth equals power and thus social status. Wealth comes from raids and is thus a privilege of great raiders and warriors. 

It is displayed through jewelry and finely crafted weapons and armor. 

## Fashion
Arnshyrans prefer to wear their mail-armor underneath large and fluffy furs. Bracelets and circlets of gold and silver flaunt their owner's wealth. 

They combine both beauty and brutality in their style of clothing. 

## Hygiene
Despite their affinity for the sea, only few Arnsyhrans can actually swim. They've little care for personal hygiene, often reeking of booze and leaving their clothes caked in dried blood, almost proudly displaying it. 

## Music and Art
Preferring war drums and horns, they don't really play music for fun, but to psyche themselves up for battle. 

Their art mostly consists of carved menhirs, resembling their gods. 

## Writing
Only the lore masters know how to read and write, often curating their own small library, but commonly being employed by chieftains to handle messenging services. 

## Cuisine
Mostly occupying the coastal regions and lacking access to arable land, they mostly eat fish or whatever they bring back from their raids. 

## Morality and Ethics
Might and the gods' favor makes right and the Arnshyrans have plenty of both. 

## Spirituality

## World View

## Sports and Competition
### Wrestling
It is customary for wrestling competitions to be held, where participants have to either force their opponent out of the ring or to the ground. Violence is encouraged. 

### Spear-fishing
Young men often compete in spear-fishing. The heavier the catch, the better. 

### Shield-Breaking
As a means of settling disputes, a competition of shield-breaking can be held, in which two duelists are equipped with an axe and round shield. They fight not to the death, but until one participant has broken three of his opponent's round shields before he breaks his.
