# Phessenich
Phessenich are a humanoid avian-people. 

They are very social creatures and strongly dislike being alone. The communities they form are usually very tight-knit, with everyone willing to help each other in whatever way possible. Despite that, they're not opposed to playing pranks on each other or competing food and mates. 

## Origin and Presence
Having been a migratory species for the longest time, no one really knows where they originally came from. It is postulated they might once have possessed greater wings, better suited to long-distance gliding and having migrated from abroad. They themselves don't know their origins and just assume they've always lived where they are now. 

They're common to the mountain ranges and coastlines of northern [Berennia](../../world/berennia/berennia) and parts of the [Ebony Peninsula](../../world/ebony-peninsula/ebony-peninsula)

They are only rarely seen outside their villages or surrounding lands. A Phessenich seen in human lands is bound to raise a few eyebrows, as that would be a very uncommon occurrence. 

## Physical Traits
Due to their hollow bones and light body weight, Phessenich are comparatively weak. 

However, their ability to fly means they generally don't have to fight and will instead usually prefer to stay out of harms way. When they do have to fight, they prefer the use of the spear, either for thrusting or for throwing. While not the best javelineers, they can reliably hit the larger creatures that might prey on them. 

Another innate ability of theirs, is their sense of direction. They have the formidable ability to tell their direction, in terms of the four cardinal directions. They might not know north, south, west and east by those names, but can always tell where those directions are, even when not exposed to the light of the sky. 

They have the ability to imitate a large range of sounds intuitively and almost to perfection. This includes other animals' sounds. 

### Diet 
Phessenich will commonly eat insects, fish, fruit and seeds or nuts. 

They will also have meat whenever an opportunity to have some presents itself. 

They can't digest most types of vegetables, however. 

### Appearance
Phessenich are humanoid avian-people. They are up to 1,4 meters tall and are mostly covered in plumage. 

Their beaks have various shapes and colors, usually largely dependent on sub-species. Lacking arms, they instead developed strong and prehensile feathers at the tips of their wings, which they can use like fingers. 

Their wings are also fairly short, making prolonged flight too difficult, rendering them  short-range gliders. 

In order to be able to fly, they have very light bodys. Their legs are very thin, the lower leg and feet are stilt-like thin. However, long toes help them stand firmly and they are quite good at keeping their balance. 

Most Phessenich have very colorful plumage, but this can vary between sub-species. 

### Lifecycle
Reproduction depends on the type of Phessenich sub-species. The oldest Phessenich are up to 50 years old. 

They start showing signs of age only very late into their lives and stay fertile for the longest part of it. 

Due to their shorter life spans, they signs of evolution at a much faster rate than most other humanoid species. 

## Magic
There are only few Phessenich that are born with the ability to control the flow of magic. Most who are are however unaware of their innate ability and may never develop any sense for it. 

Those few who recognize their ability usually become a tribe's most prized and valuable member. They are expected to use their gift to help the tribe and are usually inclined to do so.
