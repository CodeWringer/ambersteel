# Phessenich
Phessenich "culture" is more of a general understanding of what all Phessenich are generally like. They lack the wide diversity of most human populations, at least in terms of common personality traits and world views. Therefore, there are no real sub-cultures, aside from those specific to local tribes. 

## Personality
Social, dependable and cheeky describes Phessenich fairly well. They're also generally naive and live sheltered lives, far away from most of human civilization. 

However, they're also intelligent and curious creatures. Some have the courage to travel alone, but when they go out into the world, it's mostly as a group. 

## Social Interactions
Phessenich dislike being alone and so they're almost always around someone else. 

They enjoy both playing pranks on each other, as well as pondering the secrets of the world together. 

### Family
While children are generally on good terms with their parents, it is natural for mature Phessenich to be expelled from their home tribe, to go join one of the other tribes or found their own. 

### Events

### Behavioral Norms

### Social Status
Social status is reflected in one's fashionable plumage. The more foreign feathers adorn one's own plumage in interesting ways, the more well respected one is treated. 

## Fashion
It is considered very fashionable to wear another's feathers. This also renders feathers a wonderful gift for most Phessenich - especially if they're especially colorful. 

## Hygiene
They take infrequent baths, whenever necessary, but not compulsively or all the time. 

## Music and Art
They like to sing - or rather chirp - and can sound quite harmonious and uplifting even to others not of their species. 

Lacking lips, wind instruments have no meaning to them. Stringed instruments are rare, but not impossible. 

## Writing
They have no writing. Knowledge is transferred orally, there is simply no need for writing - or so they think. 

## Cuisine
Anything made of protein is on the menu, generally speaking. Sentient things are off-limits, though. 

Vegetables don't agree with their stomaches, either. 

## Morality and Ethics

## Spirituality
Phessenich revere *the egg that hatched the world*. It is their belief that all natural things are hatched. 

## World View
Phessenich believe the world to be a round, flat disc, surrounded by an infinite ocean. The firmament is a dome that holds up another ocean, but isn't water-tight. Whenever the firmament fails, it lets water through, which falls back to the earth, in the form of rain.
