# Blue-Beak Phessenich
The Blue-Beak tribe represents the eastern-most Phessenich tribe. They stand out because of their name-giving straight, blue beaks. 

They mostly live off fish off the coast. To get to the fish, they plunge from the sky, shooting into the water and grabbing their prey with their beaks, just a few seconds before shooting back out of the water. 

## Physical Traits
The Blue-Beaks are much better swimmers than the other Phessenich. Due to their even smaller body size, they are also slightly weaker than the others. They make up for that with a highly developed dexterity. 

### Appearance
They have blue colored bleaks and are generally shorter than the other types of Phessenich. Their toes are also webbed and their tail-feathers fairly strong, allowing them a great degree of control underwater and thus rendering them great swimmers.
