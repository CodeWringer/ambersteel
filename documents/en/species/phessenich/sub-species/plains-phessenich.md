# Plains Phessenich
Unlike all other known Phessenich sub-species, the plains Phessenich prefer to stay at lower elevations, where they live off agricultural produce. 

They are decent craftsmen, capable of constructing simple tools, weapons and palisades, to protect themselves. 

## Physical Traits
Heavier than the other Phessenich, the plains Phessenich struggle with prolonged flight and will generally prefer short "hops" when they make use of their wings for flight. 

Their heavier frame also allows for stronger, denser muscles, rendering them the strongest Phessenich. They might not be able to beat a human in a straight fight, but they certainly won't crumple from taking a single hit, like their brethren would. 

Despite their heavier frame, the plains Phessenich retain much of the Phessenich dexterity, allowing them to deftly dodge and avoid predators and enemies alike. 

### Appearance
At 1,65 meters tall, Plains Phessenich are slightly taller than the other kinds of Phessenich.

Another trait setting them apart is their very dark plumage. Colors range mostly from browns to blacks, so they don't stand out as much as the other Phessenich. 

To accomodate their dependency on agriculture, they developed stronger and thicker legs, as well as stronger wings and finger-feathers. They've also developed a short, thick tail, covered in fur, which further helps them keep their balance.
