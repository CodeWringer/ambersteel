# Nekhanian
Focused to the center of [Mebira](../../../world/mebira/mebira) and around the great nekhanian oasis, nekhanian culture is very localized. 

## Personality
Nekhanians are fairly reserved and polite, but also quite strict. They have an arrogant streak, but express it only subtly. 

## Social Interactions

### Family
Nekhanian women can marry only one man, as likewise, men can only marry one woman. It is customary for the women to choose their husband and it is seen as highly disrespectful for men to initiate closer relationships. While most nekhanian Maraji won't dictate how foreigners interact, even on their lands, they do expect the same male submission when they interact with Maraji women. 

Same-sex marriage is only tolerated for Maraji females, but not males. As uncommon as they are, the males are crucial to the survival of the species and it is seen as a sin for them to betray their duty to their people, by refusing to produce offspring. 

Maraji families are strictly matriarchical. While lenience is shown to foreigners, it is considered rude for foreigner males to speak out of line. When the women talk, the men must listen. 

### Events
Among the daily events in Nekhanian life is the daily prayer in one of the local sun palazas. This is an important duty for every Nekhanian. Missing prayer can have serious social repercussions. 

#### End of Summer Feast
The *End of Summer Feast* is a an annual event, commemorating the sun's impending mercy, as it relents and allows temperatures to sink to more bearable levels. It is customary for these events to be hosted on the sun plazas, with an abundance of food, drink, song and dance. It is not uncommon for Maraji women to choose their husband on such an occasion. 

#### Crescent Night
The *Crescent Night* is an annual event, held on the first of december. The necessity of the moon is ackowledged and an appeal to it made that it might not overstep its boundaries and invite too much death. Majari will commonly give gifts of crescent themed necklaces to close friends and family.

### Behavioral Norms

### Social Status
Higher social status is symbolized by the quality and cost of the jewelry one wears. When it comes to homes, especially extravagant carpets are well regarded. 

Males are generally treated worse than females and must enjoy a lower social status by default. 

## Fashion
Nekhanians love colorful and flowing cloth. They will often wear a robe with cloth draped over it. Accompanying that is jewelry in the form of bracelets, necklaces and golden diadems with silken cloth covering the head and ears. 

## Hygiene
Nekhanians pay great attention to their personal hygiene and will spend long afternoons carefully grooming their fur, to keep out dirt and parasites. When the opportunity to bathe is present, most Nekhanians will not decline. They bathe often and even in the company of others, as there is only low sexual tension between Maraji. 

## Music and Art
Maraji love both up-beat music and dance, for which specialized amphitheatres exist. In these places, there is only little seating, with the main plaza being especially big, where everyone is encouraged to join in the song and dance. 

In terms of art, Maraji have a clear tendency towards religious symbolism. Cheerfulness and life are commonly depicted by a sun, whereas coldness, loneliness and perhaps even sin and crime are depicted by the moon. 

## Writing
Many languages are recorded at the great libraries by the nekhanians. They possess a firm understanding of language and speak their trader partner's languages almost fluently. 

They prefer clay slabs as their medium, as they have clay available in abundance. For private correspondence, they prefer wrapped and wax sealed paper. 

## Cuisine
Nekhanians are used to imported food and aren't picky when it comes to what they eat, although they do prefer meat and fish and love to add spices to every dish.  

## Morality and Ethics
Most female Nekhanians see males as the sons of the moon, sinful and depraved by nature and will treat them worse than members of their own gender. This belief may even extend to males of the other races, such as humans, although most Nekhanians are more lenient when it comes to scolding a human male for his sins. 

They see their society only as strong as their weakest link and so they aim to help each other where they can, as they believe thus all others benefit, too. 

A painful history of magic-abuse has dulled nehkanian will to use magic to resolve disputes. Regardless of their hesitation towards it, magic is seen as a useful tool, that, when wielded well, can benefit all of society. 

## Sports and Competition
Sports and competitions are seen as forms of domestic adventure. It is not so much the victory that counts, as does the participation. Winners are looked up to, admired and serve as a symbol of nekhanian strength. 

A common form of competitional sport is the *moon sprint*, which involves an obstacle course dotted with several targets that each must be stabbed with a spear, exactly once. The precision of the stabs and the speed at which the obstacle course is completed determine the victor. 

Another sport is the competitional dance, where partners are randomly chosen to dance together, after a short preparation time. A jury decides on the victor, based on perceived elegance, fluidity and speed of motion. 

## World View
Most Nekhanians believe the continents to be island floating upon an infinite, curving sea. 

They see the other civilizations around them as barbaric. They lack nekhanian empathy and are commonly ruled by tyrannical men. 

## Names
Being a society mostly consisting of females, most names have a strong tendency toward softer sounds, including many "j", "gh" and "ph" sounds. 

Last names usually revolve around things considered beautiful, such as gems metals and color.
