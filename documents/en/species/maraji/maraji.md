## Origin and Presence
The Maraji originate in the hot south lands, where they are usually closely integrated into human society. There even exists a city-state, *Nekha*, which is entirely governed by them. 

They usually roam the larger cities in great numbers, wheras the smaller towns and villages may only contain a few of them. 

No one really knows the true origin of the Maraji, although it is assumed that they were created during the golden age of magic. Their high sensitivity to magic would support that argument, although no one can quite explain why or how the Maraji would have been created. 

## Physical Traits
Maraji are especially flexible and dexterous, giving them an edge over anyone slower than them. 

They walk completely upright, much like humans do, making them more relatable for most humans. Most humans regard their digitigrade legs as quite off-putting, however. 

Males are usually slightly stronger and aggressive than females, but also less numerous than the females. Only one in three Maraji are born a male. 

Their short and sleek fur allows only little heat to reach their body from the outside. Additionally, their body temperature is slightly higher than that of humans, allowing them to withstand the oppressive heat of the desert more easily. However, this also means that they are less resistant to the intense cold of the desert nights. 

Their higher body temperature also implies that bio-chemical processes run quicker in their bodies, allowing them to think and react quicker than most humans. On the other hand, it also means Maraji need to eat more often and take frequent small naps to retain their strength. 

They can see well at night and their rectractable claws and padded feet allows them to walk very quietly, if they choose to. 

Maraji have a strong sense of curiosity, that often drives them to explore distant lands. 

### Diet 
It would be difficult to imagine a Maraji banquet without plates amply filled with many different types of spiced meats or sweet fruits. 

Seeing vegetables however, should be deeply disturbing, as they simply cannot digest vegetables, at all. 

### Appearance
There is a clear elegance to every single motion of any Maraji, as an expression of their self-control and dexterity. 

They can be up to 1,70 meters tall. Their build is usually quite lean, with only a few individuals being bulkier. 

They fur is fairly short and can be colored very diversely. Anything from sandy-beige to fiery orange is possible. Patterns are also a very common feature of their fur coat. Stripes, dots and waves are all just a sample of what's possible. 

Maraji enjoy wearing colorful and elegant clothes. But also jewelry, such as bracelets, necklaces and diadems with cloth covering the head and ears. 

### Lifecycle
Maraji can be up to 65 years old and multiply slower than humanity. 

They feel the effects of old age only late into their lives, but when they do, the end is usually close for them. 

## Magic
Many Maraji are born with magic abilities and a sense to recognize them. 

## Miscellaneous
Maraji are highly religious creatures. Almost every Maraji worships the sun, which is seen as both oppressive and benevolent at the same time. At night, when freezing, you wish it still shined and at midday, when oppressive heat forces all life to a stand-still, you wish it stopped. They follow strict rules, imposed by their religion. 

There is little that Maraji enjoy as much as lounging on a comfortable pillow, near a window and overlooking the bustle of the city around them. 

Maraji rely heavily on their dexterity, working as very capable craftsmen, artists, acrobats, musicians and other entertainers, as well as scholars.

Those few Maraji who are born without the magic gift do not enjoy a high standing in Maraji society. Instead, they usually take to the arena, where they try to earn fame and glory as a gladiator.
