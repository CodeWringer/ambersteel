# Arborean
The Arboreans are not a natural species. These humanoid, walking, talking tree-creatures were created a long time ago by a powerful mage, though for what reasons remains unknown. 

## Origin and Presence
Arboreans can be found in the densest, most ancient woods of [Berennia](../../world/berennia/berennia) - the [Elder Woods](../../world/berennia/elder-woods). 

## Physical Traits
They're large, strong and resilient. 

Their high intellect is betrayed by their poor memory. If they don't capture knowledge, it will quickly escape them. 

When in motion, they can be surprisingly agile, even if not very subtle. They creak and croak as they move and their heavy foot steps announce their advance. 

### Diet
Due to their physique, they have no need to eat food in the traditional sense. They will derive their nourishment from the earth that they tread. As such, they don't feel comfortable in areas where there is no soil available to them. 

### Appearance
Most of their physique can be described as that of a humanoid tree. The face resembles an owl's visage and antlers adorn the head. Large claws protrude from clumsy hands and stumps serve as feet. 

### Lifecycle
Being magically created, they don't have a natural way of reproducing. When near the end of their life-cycle, which can be several centuries old, they return to the [Elder Tree](../../bestiary/magical/elder-tree), where they plant themselves, grow roots and conjoin with it. The elder tree, nourished by that new strength grows new Arboreans from its roots. It can take up to a century for a new generation to be "born". 

The [Elder Tree](../../bestiary/magical/elder-tree) is their species' life-line. They will do anything to protect it. 

## Magic
They are quite well attuned to magic and can control the flow of magic around them almost effortlessly. Their particular type of magic is completely alien to that human mages are familiar with. It is focused around growth, preservation and control.
