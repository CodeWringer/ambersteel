# Zakkid
A race of humanoid insectoids, uniquely attuned to the winds of magic and peculiarly socially minded. They are a semi-hive mind, as individuals have their own free will, but are always focused on the good of the hive.

## Origin and Presence
The Zakkids are one of the elder races of the old world, having been around for even longer than humanity. 

Despite their race's age, they aren't nearly as widely present as humans. 

## Physical Traits
Not being particularly strong, dexterous or adaptable, the Zakkids' primary strength instead lies in their intellect and magical attunement. 

Non-queen Zakkid are asexual and have no concept of individual procreation. 

Their blood is colored purple and is fairly poisonous to non-insectoids. 

### Diet
The Zakkeian diet is quite varied, consisting of smaller, non-sentient insectoids, vegetables, fruit and meat every now and then. Most of their food stems from the underground caves they inhabit. 

### Appearance
Zakkids are, on average, about 2 meters tall and mostly slender creatures, although there are some exceptions. 

They are covered in a thick chitinous exoskeleton which both keeps their flesh together and protected from outside influence. 

A long tail helps them keep their balance, while their long, digitigrade legs enable them to reach great speeds and jump great heights. 

Long feelers protrude from the sides or tops of their heads, allowing them to sense and control magical flow around them with a high degree of accuracy and ease. 

Some Zakkids are born with wings and the ability to hover short distances, but their weight renders them ill-suited to prolonged flight. 

### Lifecycle
They are some of the longest-lived sentient creatures of the old world, with some members of their species becoming up to three centuries old. 

## Magic
Zakkids are highly magically capable creatures. Every Zakkid unlocks their magic abilities only a few years after their birth and magic represents an integral part of Zakkeian life.
