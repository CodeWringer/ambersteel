# Zakkeian
Zakkeian culture is centered around the interests of the hive. Co-operation and respect is key to zakkeian life. However, cultural inertia is high and they rarely innovate. 

## Personality
Zakkids are generally very reserved and respectful. They are peculiarly socially minded. 

Unlike humans, they consider not themselves and their own well-being first, but rather that of their peers. Being a species of a semi-hive-mind, they never developed a strong sense of egoism, which often puts them at odds with the other peoples, who fail to understand them. 

They speak only, when they have something meaningful to say. They will listen for others to finish speaking and make sure to pay attention. Resources are freely shared, guests treated like friends and goals are pursued co-operatively. 

Despite their openness, they are not naive. They will be guarded against strangers and probe their intentions. They will defend themselves against foes and they will rationally weigh threats. But it will always be for the good of their people. 

They prefer to outmaneuver and outwit opponents, or if need be, to overwhelm them with magic. Generally though, they will tend to avoid conflict altogether as it is not in their nature to seek it. 

## Social Interactions
Zakkids are very socially active creatures. They look out for each other, protect each other and care for their ill with selfless zeal. 

Sunbathing and philosophizing together are popular pastimes, as well as craftsmanship and artistry. It is not uncommon for Zakkids to be actively looking for apprentices to pass their skills on to. Likewise, most Zakkids will be on a constant quest for knowledge. Masters take great pride in the successes of their apprentices and their apprentices will gratefully accept all knowledge. 

Instead of taverns, they meet, talk and feast together in the numerous great halls that connect underways, which is also where they organize most common activities and just generally socialize. 

### Family
Family isn't a topic considered very noteworthy to most Zakkids. Due to their natural concern for all their peers, they consider family no more valueable than anyone else not at all related to their lineage. 

### Events
#### Congregation of Skills
Every once in a while, not at regular intervals, but whenever enough masters feel they could take on new apprentices, a great competition festival is held, which takes about a week to complete. 

Every master competes against their peers, showcasing their skills, by completing various challenges or creating great works. Other Zakkids, who aren't masters yet, will watch attentively and once the week is over, will approach their prospective masters and apply as apprentices. 

Fresh food is served and drinks handed out freely. There is much talk and many new acquaintances made. 

#### Burials
Death of fellow Zakkids is taken very seriously. Great memorial services are held and likenesses of the deceased carved from stone slabs, to be arranged in burial chambers by the [white shells](). 

### Behavioral Norms
It is considered unacceptable to harm or hinder other Zakkids. 

Zakkids must dedicate their lives to the betterment of the hive. 

### Social Status
Social standing is difficult to pinpoint, as it is with humans, because a greater burden of responsibility is what, in large part, governs social standing. It doesn't so much cause a divide in society, as it instead strengthens their pride in their hive. 

To help someone who's shouldering a heavier burden than oneself, is seen as a great honor. 

## Fashion
Zakkeians wear a surprising amount of cloth, considering they see little practical value in it. However, it is common practice for apprentices to thank their masters or to honor those of great responsibility by gifting them cloth in the colors of their burden. 

Cloth is dyed according to the responsibilities of their recipient. 
* Red and gold is reserved solely for the queen. 
* White stands for the burden of death - the [white shells]().
* Black and purple represents the burden of war. 
* Black and gold represents leadership and assistance to the queen. 
* Brown is the base color for artisans. Combinations with other colors further specify the type of art and material worked. 
* Brown in combination with green represents the burden of farming and cooking. Growing, harvesting, preparing and serving food.
* Grey is the base color for craftsmen. Combinations with other colors further specify the type of craft and material worked. 
* Blue stands for the burden of healthcare. 
* Orange is the burden of lore-keeping. 

Jewelry serves as an even greater form of praise and reverence. Colored gemstones, also following the rules of color associations are valuable gifts. 

## Hygiene
Zakkids take great care of themselves. They will frequently scrub parasites and dirt off of their carapaces. There is an entire caste of workers dedicated to healthcare, which includes hygiene. They will remain at the [scrubbing chambers](), where they help others clean or where they make sure to desinfect the wounded before hurrying them on to the ward. 

## Music and Art
Zakkeian music is not so much music in the human sense, to whom it would seem completely alien. It is a strange melody of mandible scraping and humming at alternating pitch and rythm, that might almost seem pleasant to human ears, were it not so raspy. 

## Writing
Zakkids keep detailed records of all their collective knowledge in large library chambers, in the form of carved abyssalite slabs. Touching the slabs and letting a subtle air of magic flow through, magically conveys the memories entrapped therein to the caster.

## Cuisine
To non-Zakkids, their cuisine will seem bizarre, as it mostly consists of small insects, cave flora and localized spices. But like most creatures, the Zakkids, too, enjoy finely decorated and well seasoned meals. 

## Morality and Ethics
Zakkids are respectful and avoid conflict whenever possible. It is seen as distasteful to take life without need. Despite that, they have no moral qualms consuming non-sentient life. 

Life is centered around the good of the whole. Burdens of responsibility are not taken lightly. Instead, great responsibility is honored and revered. Above all, the queen's life is the most treasured and taking care of her well-being is the most valuable burden of the hive. 

## Spirituality
Zakkids revere and fear [Abyssalite](../../../magic/abyssalite). Great monoliths of Abyssalite stand isolated, in great chambers, where they are ritualistically circled by pilgrims. 

They consider the usage of Abyssalite for war distasteful. It may happen, as a necessity during war time, but even then, only once all other options have been exhausted, as Zakkids know full well of the devastating power of focused magic. 

## World View
Zakkids are acutely aware that the world is a globe. They map star patterns, measure seismic activity and understand plate tectonics. Above all, they understand the flow of magic profoundly and can sense it circling the world. 

## Sports and Competition
Competitions barely take place in zakkeian society. If not in the context of the [Congregation of Skills](#Congregation-of-Skills), there is little reason to compete with each other. As such, innovation rarely takes place, as there is barely any push for it. 

Most commonly, innovation is brought by outsiders, most notably human scholars who visit the hives out of curiosity. At least, that's how it was before the trek through [Berennia](../../../world/berennia/berennia) became too dangerous. 

## Names
Names focusing on harsh phonetics, plenty of "k" or "x" sounds. 

Zakkeian names are a combination of a first and last name, as well as the color of their primary responsibility. Example: "Kirill Xyran the white".
