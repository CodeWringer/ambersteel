# Varg
The Varg are a race of humanoid wolves. For the longest time most of the human world - wrongly - thought them another type of werewolf.

## Origin and Presence
There are many legends regarding the origin of the Varg. Some consider them werewolves who forgot their human form, but others think them the product of magic interference and yet another theory is that they originated from another continent, but how they got to this one is commonly left uncertain. 

They usually live as nomads in the wilderness, in small packs. There are also those "civilized" Varg who live in human territories, although there aren't many of them. 

## Physical Traits
They are very strong and are quite resilient. A lot of wounds are needed to force a Varg to their knees. 

As canine-esque creatures, they also possess a formidable sense of smell. They can practically "see" smells and identify any of them, even when assaulted by a myriad of different and strong smells. 

### Diet
Varg almost exclusively eat meat and fish. They will also eat certain types of fruit, if desperate and starving. 

They simply cannot digest vegetables. 

### Appearance
Varg are up to 2.3 meters tall and generally appear very brutish, as they have a wide frame and somewhat hunched over posture. 

Fur color can vary widely, but mostly keeps to darker and less noticeable colors. A few, rare individuals have been seen with a white fur coat, usually near the northern edges of the world. There can also be various patterns in their fur and the coarseness can vary, as well. 

Eye colors range from polar blue to sparkling honey-yellow. 

It is not uncommon for Varg to have several scars, as evidence of past fights.

A Varg wearing clothes is a sight solely reserved for those who live amongst humans, because otherwise most humans would not  recognize them as anything more than mere animals. The Varg out in the wilderness usually wear a loincloth and sparse ornaments such as simple necklaces and bracelets and the occasional tanned hide worn as a trophy.  

### Lifecycle
Varg can become up to 60 years old, although the effects of age already manifest very early during their lives, sometimes as early as at age 30. Such effects can be the fur losing its color and sight worsening. Their sense of smell will remain strong until their very deaths, however. 

## Magic
There are some Varg who are born with magical abilities, who usually assume the role of pack shaman. 

They try to aid others with what little healing magic they can summon, be it to try and counteract the effects of age or to heal wounds. 

Some Varg may even recognize ways in which to use magic for destructive purposes, mastering simpler destruction spells. 

## Miscellaneous
Varg are nomadic hunter-gatherers, that prefer to live in the wilderness. Only rarely does a Varg wander onto human land, where the Varg is usually quickly driven away. 

They have little understanding of human nations and borders, much less the laws protecting them. This is why most humans see them as thieves, bandits and even invaders. They have been known to take livestock from farms or food from travelers. 

A Varg that lives in the civilized world, was most likely separated from their parents at a young age and then raised by the humans that found them. Such "civilized" Varg can very well act as functioning members of human society, usually serving as capable hunters and lumberjacks, decent craftsmen or enthusiastic butchers. Although such Varg live amongst them, most humans remain sceptical of them.
