# Nomad traders of Nekha
These nomadic traders roam the sands between the great nations of [Mebira](..\world\mebira\mebira.md), riding their great [sand striders](../bestiary/beasts/sand-strider) and connecting the various settlements and cities along the way, supplying them with imports from abroad. 

Strapped to the sides of the beasts, are overhangs that provide shade to everything below the creature, to help potential customers keep a cool head as they peruse the wares that hang below the strider's belly. In front of their wares, also on the underside of the creature, sits its owner and driver. A harness around the strider's head allows the driver to control the direction of movement by tugging on the affixed straps. 

## Hierarchy
There is no clear hierarchy, just caravans heading a common direction and agreeing to protect each other. 

## Beliefs, Morals, Ethics
The nomads tend to travel together and will seek to cooperate, as there are many dangers that stalk the deserts, which cannot be faced alone. 

## Symbolism
They like imagery of their [sand striders](../bestiary/beasts/sand-strider) and tend to wear jewelry depicting these magnificent beasts of burden. 

## Rituals and Rites
It is common for these nomads to camp together and they like to sit by the same camp fire, keeping warm at night. 

## Obligations
