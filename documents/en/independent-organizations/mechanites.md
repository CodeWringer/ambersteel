# Mechanites
The Mechanites are an internationally active group of individuals devoting their lives to the development of advanced technology. They research and utilize the power of steam in new and innovative ways and jealously guard the secrets they uncover.

## Hierarchy
At the head of the organization stands the **council** of five. Five of the eldest and most renowned Mechanites step up to lead the organization and guard it against threats and thieves. They also oversee the collective resources of the organization and what projects to invest in.

The **masters** oversee the apprentices and complete most of the work involved in the organization's projects. These are long-standing members of the organization who have proven themselves. They act as the primary working force of the Mechanites. 

**Curators** are hand-picked masters who are tasked with tending to external relations and the acquisition of new talent. They wander the civilized world, handing out contracts to promising craftsmen and scholars, to determine their value to the organization.

New members are accepted only after a long period of careful observation and trust building. They are dubbed **apprentices**, regardless of their prior accomplishments or skill-level. Any apprentice must prove themselves by furthering the works of the Mechanites. Also, one does not approach the Mechanites to join, they approach and initiate relations with entry-level contracts. The manufacture of needed components and parts or the acquisition of research data are some such tasks.

## Beliefs, Morals, Ethics
Deeply rooted in their society is the belief that there is a soul in every steam-powered machine. It must be tended to and taught manners, like a child.

Every Mechanite is taught to believe in the soul in the machine. Every steam-powered device, gadget and greater machine contains a soul. It is born from the first firing and it will die with the last ember. 

Fledgling machines must be taught manners and purpose. Teaching methods often involve tools and tinkering to reach the desired performance. A stern talking to is also a common practice, though its effectiveness is so far unproven.

One must not be disruptive to other Mechanites' work. One must not steal from or harm other Mechanites. Basically, anything facilitating productive and cooperative work is encouraged and everything else is not.

## Symbolism
All Mechanites of rank master or higher wear a silver broach with a wrench crossing half a gear. 

Council members instead wear a steel broach shaped like a cowl covering an eye.
