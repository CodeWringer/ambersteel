# Amber Order
The Amber Order is the driving organization behind [Amberantism](../religions/amberantism). The Order holds great power and has political ties into several of the [old world](../world/world)'s nations. Their power even extends so far as to allow them to enforce laws upon mages in many countries, because the local rulers have delegated that power to them. 

## Hierarchy
### Condemned
Condemned mages, who have been found guilty of crimes against humanity, are treated very poorly, often forced to work to death, if not executed outright. They are usually either kept locked up or forced to work. Unlike the subdued, they're not assigned any areas they're allowed to roam free.  

### Subdued
Mages who have been subdued are usually treated fairly, provided they cooperate. [Amberite](../magic/amberite) collars or bracelets keep their magical abilities in check and they are essentially forced to work for the order. 

As reward for their penance, subdued mages are assigned areas, which may be as large as entire provinces, where they are allowed to roam free, provided they stay on 'good behavior'.

### Initiate 
The lowest ranked members, they fulfill most everyday roles to keep the order running. 

### Ordinator
They enforce amberantist rules and beliefs within the order. 

### Purifier
The finest warriors in amberantist service, they are pious and relentless. These are the troops sent out to subdue or execute mages and to purify areas falling to magical corruption. 

### Purifier Captain
The leader of a contingent of purifiers. 

### Judge
The judges are the few individuals, stationed at the great fortresses of the order, who decide the fates of those who stand accused. 

### Warden
The second-in-command of the Amberantist Order, the warden handles the armed forces and military doctrine. 

### High Judge
The highest ranking member, the spiritual and legislative leader of the order. 

## Beliefs, Morals, Ethics
See [Amberantism](../religions/amberantism#beliefs,-morals,-ethics).

However, members of the order also believe there is a greater distinction between followers than the religion itself lets on. Greater virtue awards geater responsibility and power.
