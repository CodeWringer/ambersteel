# Alchemy
Alchemy is generally seen as another aspect of magic, although it lacks the facetuous casting of spells. Instead, the exact preparation and brewing of plant matter, certain metals and liquids allows potions with magic-esque effect to be created. 

The exact interaction between alchemy and the winds of magic is still not well understood, but it is clear that alchemical produce seems to channel the winds of magic, similarly to how runes do. 

Alchemists can brew a large variety of potions. Disinfecing wounds, enhancing an individual's perceptive ability, poisons and even explosives are all possible. 

Due to the complexity and amount of work that is involved, alchemists are a rather rare occurrence. It is hard enough to find a capable and knowledgable teacher. Documentation on the subject is also rare. 

In the previous age, when magic was prevalent, alchemy wasn't well regarded. It was seen as a waste of time and inferior to real magic, anyways. Therefore, only not magically able humans dabbled in the subject. Often, however, due to a lack of understanding, they failed to produce meaningful potions or even worse, created volatile and dangerous substances, that they themselves often fell victim to.
