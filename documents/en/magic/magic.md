# Magic
Magic exists as a tangible force in the world, but is a rare occurrence in most parts of the old world. 

Not every human can alter the magic flow in order to cast magic. Such an ability is innate and few individuals are born with it. 

In the early history of the world, mages were a lot more commonplace and posed as the absolute and rightful rulers of the world. This is now commonly known as the era of magical tyranny. 

Just a century ago, was Norvolis destroyed by Kovalevsky Taras, the most powerful necromancer of this age. He unleashed an unstoppable plague, that devastated the city almost overnight. He reanimated the dead and bound their decaying husks to his will. With his army of undead, he conquered large parts of the old world and announced the dawn of a new era of magic.

Even before the rise of the necromancer, mages were met with great skepticism. But now they are faced with downright hate and disdain, resulting in prosecution and public executions of magic users all over the old world. 

Not all human lands share this hatred, however. The further south one looks, the fewer religious zealots and witch hunters one finds. 

And yet, mages must watch out, for their gift is more perilous than ever. 

## Casting Magic
In order to cast a spell, a mage must focus on the magic winds surrounding them and channel them. When releasing them, they will be imbued with the caster's intent, causing the desired effect to take hold. 

In order to aid with the channeling, a mage may choose to perform flow-directing hand motions. The more experienced a mage is, the less likely he is to require performing elaborate hand motions to cast lower complexity spells. 

Due to the exhaustion a mage experiences when casting complex spells, the amount of magic that can be cast in rapid succession is limited by one's ability to withstand the ill-effects that ensue. 

## Complexity of Magic
Spells become more difficult to cast, the more complex they become. A spell's complexity is increased by its range and area of effect, as well as the intensity and type of desired effect. Also a factor is the potential chaining of effects, which almost exponentially increases the complexity. 

If attempting to cast a spell above their skillset, a mage may lose consciousness or otherwise be forced to abort channeling magic, due to the ill-effects they experience. When the channeled magic flow is released, it may have unpredictable effects, or no effects at all.

## Exclusivity of Magic
Magical ability is always innate and cannot be learned by the magically incapable. 

## Sensitivity to Magic
Those magically capable find themselves sensitive to the winds and flow of magic around them. The stronger the concentration of magic becomes, due to either them or someone nearby channeling, the more adversely affected they will be. 

Magic can cause ill-effects. The more magic being channeled, the stronger the ill-effects. It starts with dizziness and exhaustion and works its way up to nausea, even loss of consciousness. 

It takes a lot of experience, strength of will and a strong constitution for a mage to resist these ill-effects. 

At its most extreme, the channeled magic is so strong that it may well tear apart any magically sensitive creatures, if they cannot withstand the turbulence. Even those who are magically insensitive may be affected by such magical winds. The effects that ensue are entirely unpredictable and may range from the same ill-effects that magically sensitive would experience, to changes in physiology, such as body mutations. 

## Magic after-effects
Magic affects and disrupts the flow of magic. Such disturbances can be sensed, for a time. 

Very strong magic flow causes a vacuum to form, which remains for a short time. Such a vacuum does not remain for long, however, as new winds flow in to fill the void. Depending on the amount of magic channeled and cast out, the after flow can become very turbulent, even violent and that even to those who are magically insensitive.
