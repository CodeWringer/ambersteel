# Abyssalite
Abyssalite is a metal that can only be acquired from the depths of the earth. It usually comes from the [Great Wounds of The World](../world/great-wounds), where the earth cracked open and gigantic chasms run deep into the earth's crust. 

Abyssalite can amplify the flow of magic. If certain runes are carved into the stones, the magic flow can even be guided in a way that allows the otherwise magically incapable of casting magic. 

Its surface is unnaturally smooth and covered in a fine, iridescent shine. Underneath the smooth surface, one searches for depth and color in vain. It is as though the void itself was being contained by that iridescent shell. 

Abyssalite is a hard and brittle material, prone to shattering if too much force is applied. This makes it difficult to shape.
