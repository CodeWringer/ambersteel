# Amberite
As magic is amplified by [Abyssalite](abyssalite), its antithesis is called Amberite, which dulls the effects of magic and slows any magic flow. The material is also known to affect magic creatures and can cause great pain in magic-users. 

Weapons made from Amberite are quite popular with witch and monster hunters alike, although fairly hard to come by, due to the difficulty in amber-iron processing. 

Amberite is a crystalline material, that can be molten down and shaped, like iron. It glows weakly, in the fiery orange of the name-sharing amber stone. Near the edges, the glow fades to a dull reflection, like cooling molten glass. 

It only occurs naturally in a few select places in the world, where the ground offers the right conditions. Amberite grows over time, in the right environment. It can take several decades for a finger-sized crystal to grow to the size of an adult man's forearm. Attempts to cultivate it have mostly failed, as Amberite farmers have so far been unable to understand and reproduce the right conditions for it to thrive. Due to the slow rate at which it grows, an Amberite farmer may not realize the lack of growth until well into a decade later. 

Prolonged exposure to Amberite causes severe ill-effects with nausea and migranes being common symptoms. 

## Ambersteel
Amberite can be processed into Ambersteel, which makes it a usable metal. The raw material heats slowly and must be heated over the course of several days and nights, without interruption. When it finally reaches the right temperature, it will glow white, with a purple sheen. At that point, it can be hammered into shape. Constant re-heating ensures it stays at the right temperature and a final quenching in vegetable oil ensures it retains its flexibility. 

If processed outside the optimal temperature, the material quickly grows brittle and will shatter if any stress is put on it.

Due to the length of the process and the difficulty in keeping the right temperature, smiths capable of working amber-iron are rare.
