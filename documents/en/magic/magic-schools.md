# Magic Schools
All magic is categorized by one of the several magic schools. 

## Soul-Binding
All knowledge pertaining to the binding of souls, which is the act of animating otherwise inanimate material. This practice is also commonly known as necromancy, when dead bodies are reanimated. 

The general idea is simple - call forth a soul from the [Plane of The Dead](../../world/plane-of-dead) and bind it to some object that the soul may understand to manipulate. That part is crucial, however, as a toad will generally not understand human limbs and lacks any imagination for it. This is why human souls make for some of the best souls to bind - humans are imaginative creatures that can adapt well to changing circumstance. This means that a human soul can be bound to almost any humanoid shaped vessel (like a dead body) and they will do a great job animating it. 

The reason souls can be bound, is that they want to flee the [Plane of The Dead](../../world/plane-of-dead) and will do anything to stay in the material plane of existence. It is easy to lure souls over to the material plane, the soul-binder simply opens their soul tether by a certain amount. Any soul that reaches them will then pass into their body through the open tether. The difficult part then is to cast them out of the body and into whatever they're to be bound to. Failing to cast them out will inevitably result in the wayward soul taking over the body, displacing the original owner's soul and thus condemning it to the [Plane of The Dead](../../world/plane-of-dead). 

Whatever the target of the binding is, must bear a runic symbol that the soul will be bound to, if it is an otherwise inanimate object. Forcing another soul into a living body is also possible, but very difficult, as already bound souls resist being displaced with all their might. 

Such a symbol can be drawn with paint, although such a solution would be very weak, carved into the material, which would provide a strong binding or be in the form of a [rune](../../magic/runes), which provides a near unbreakable binding. The complexity of the runic symbol dictates the degree of freedom the bound soul will have. A very constricting and simple symbol lends itself well only to non-autonomous thralls, such as [zombies](../../bestiary/undead/zombie). The more intricate and larger the runic symbol, the more freedom a soul-bound creature enjoys. However, as the complexity of the symbol increases, so does the process of creating it. 

It isn't quite understood what the [Plane of The Dead](../../world/plane-of-dead) looks like, if there is in fact any physicality to it and what's more, why souls wish to escape it so badly, but it is generally assumed that an open soul tether must shine brightly, like a great beacon, and thus draw any nearby souls in, like moths to a candle. 

If the soul-binder wishes to bind a specific soul, like that of a specific dead comrade, then they must expect having to reject several wayward souls that wish to enter their body through the open soul tether. It takes great skill and concentration to do so and only grows harder, the more souls arrive and push against the open soul tether. 

### Soul-banishing
The inverse of binding a soul from the [Plane of The Dead](../../world/plane-of-dead), is banishing a soul to it. This procedure generally only works with souls openly looking for a new host. This means this technique is mostly useful to curse-lifters and witch-hunters, as a weapon against the undead. 

## Pyromancy
The summoning and control of fire.

## Cryomancy
The summoning and control of ice.

## Restoration
The mending of wounds and treatment of diseases. 

## Alteration
The alteration of physical things, to change their shape and purpose. 

## Illusion
Creation of non-physical influences on the senses. 

## Counter-Magic
The redirection and dissolution of magic flow.
