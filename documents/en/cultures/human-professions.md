# Human Professions
This document outlines a non-exhaustive collection of the professions typically found in most human societies. 

## Animal Trainer
An animal trainer is tasked with domesticating and training animals to obey simple commands. 

They're usually servants of nobles, training their pets, or employed by anyone in need of guard dogs. The most successful animal trainers are often very empathetic and strong of will. 

Animal training is often looked down upon - usually through ignorance of the skill that goes into it - and not well-paid. 

## Apothecary
An apothecary hoards scribbled notes and tomes of knowledge, hoping to make sense of the complex riddle of medicine. 

They use their knowledge and experience to create tinctures, salves and potions. Some have genuine healing properties, while others are mere dreams in a bottle. 

It is because of the many charlatans and quacks that apothecaries are often regarded with great scepticism and blame for whenever their medicines seemingly don't work or don't work fast enough. Ignorance of the masses is the quack's blessing and the professional's curse. 

Apothecaries need an astute mind and are served well by a high intelligence, wisdom, perception and empathy. 

## Armorer
Armor smithing isn't anywhere near the same discipline as forging iron nails or shoes for horses. This is a well-honed art, passed down for generations of masters and apprentices. 

Armorers often own their own work shop or work in a leased space. Several apprentices help fulfill orders on time and work on the simpler pieces. 

Due to the cost of material, time and labor involved, armorers demand great compensation for their work. Some might consider the prices too steep, but then again, a master-work armor could save their wearer's life in a crucial moment. Can you really put a price on that?

Armorers need not only raw strength, but also good perception and endurance. 

## Antiquarian

## Astrologer

## Barber
Cutting your own hair in a way that doesn't make you look ridiculous after wards is surprisingly difficult. It helps to have someone else, with a better view and reach on things. Enter the barber. 

Despite how grateful people generally are, they don't pay well for the services of a barber. Nobles and other rich folk tend to show a lot more gratitude, however. 

Barbers benefit from a high agility, perception and empathy, to achieve the cut their customer wants. 

## Barber Surgeon
When cutting hair doesn't pay the bills, cutting off limbs or removing arrow shafts is requires *roughly* the same skill set...

Barber surgeons do both jobs, of a barber and a surgeon. Sort of. For anything invasive, you'd be best advised to seek a proper surgeon. 

You might also get a tattoo from them. 

Barber surgeons benefit from a high agility, perception, empathy and intelligence, to achieve the cut their customer wants. 

## Bailiff

## Bodyguard

## Bounty Hunter

## Bowyer
Just about anyone can grab a stick, tie a string to it and pretend it's a war-bow. But only a bowyer knows which stick to pick and how to work it in a way that prevents it snapping on first draw of the string. 

Bowyers are well served by strength, perception, wisdom and some agility. 

Why strength? Because one has to test their products, before selling them. That implies being able to draw back the string of a war-bow, at least once. That's around 160 to 180 pounds of drawing weight. Anyone untrained can hurt themselves even just attempting to draw the string back. 

Despite the skill that goes into it, most bowyers aren't paid particularly well. 

## Captain (Maritime)

## Cartographer

## Chandler

## Charcoal Burner

## Cook

## Courtesan

## Criminal

## Draper / Tailor

## Entertainer

## Envoy

## Executioner
Executioners are often shunned for their work and forced to live offside society. It is considered dirty and honorless work and thus also not paid well, at all. 

And yet every lord needs one.

They need strength and toughness for their line of work.

Peons generally paid miserably, just about enough to eat for a day. 

Not much is asked of peons. They need raw strength and endurance to be of use.
