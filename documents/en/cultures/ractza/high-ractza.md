Distanced, with their backs to the wall.

Much in their lives revolves around the reverence of their gods and their Zilkeans. Regular offerings are made to appease both. 

## Fashion
Many Rac'tza love to adorn themselves with feathers. They will wear intricately decorated cloths, with feathers attached to them in many creative ways. Not so much clothing, as humans would wear, but enough to allow them to distinguish themselves visually.

The bathing temples enjoy many visitors each day. High Rac'tza take their hygiene fairly seriously.

Exotic spices and ingredients bring great flavour to every meal. The spicier, the better.
