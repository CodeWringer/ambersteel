# High Rac'tzean
The most wide-spread of the Rac-tza, they represent the dominant society of the new world. 

They're a dignified and vain people, partial to jewelry and silken clothes. Generally, they're fairly self-centered, resourceful and calculating. 

That's not to say they're uncommunal. They're respectful, ritualistic and honorable. 

Almost all High Rac'tza worship their ancestory. The greatest members of their society are deified and represent examples to live by. 

The concept of currency is unfamiliar to them.
