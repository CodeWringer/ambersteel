# Moon
The moon tribe are especially active during the night. They worship the moon with greater enthusiasm than their ancestors and often howl in its embrace, deep in the night. 

Unlike other Fenris, the moon tribe are nomadic and will rarely stay in one location. This often puts them at odds with other tribes and species, as they'll commonly intrude on their territory. 

In response, the moon tribe are more aggressively minded and spend much of their time preparing to fight. Still, they believe it best to keep moving. Much like the moon moves every night, so must they.
