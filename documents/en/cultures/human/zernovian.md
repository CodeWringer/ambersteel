# Zernovian
Zernovian culture dominated large parts of the eastern wing of the [old world](../../../world/world), before the [Creeping Death](../../../bestiary/horrors/creeping-death) forced them from their home land of [Berennia](../../../world/berennia/berennia). 

Now, most of them wander the westen wing of the [old world](../../../world/world) as refugees and nomadic day laborers. Some have been taken in by the western nations, while others are denying them permanent rights of residence. 

Many Zernovians are polite and dignified people, with a strong sense of pride. However, since they were forced from their homes, many have also grown bitter and cynical. 

Where once many Zernovians were too prideful to stoop to the level of a common criminal or beggar, things have now changed. Desperation, bitterness and even insanity has taken hold in many a Zernovian's mind.
