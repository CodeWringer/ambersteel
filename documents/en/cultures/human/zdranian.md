# Zdránian
Zdránians are a very communal and religious people, with a strong sense of compassion and hospitality. 

Family is very extended and hard to break apart. Even distant cousins and ex-partners are still considered a part of the family. 

Religion is important, but which gods are to be worshipped is a question of much debate, with the pantheon of choice frequently changing. 

At least, once, Zdrànians were like this. Now, since the [Creeping Death](../../../bestiary/horrors/creeping-death) forced them from their home land of [Berennia](../../../world/berennia/berennia), they've grown closer to each other and far more wary of non-family. Bitterness and insanity have taken hold of many.
