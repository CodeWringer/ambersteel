# Vertissian
The umbrella culture *Vertissian* is dominated and defined by reverence of [faery dragons](../../../../bestiary/draconic/faery-dragon.md) and in particular, the [Elder Dragon](../../../../bestiary/draconic/elder-dragon.md). All art, music, architecture, morals and ethics are strongly inspired by and adapted to [faery dragons](../../../../bestiary/draconic/faery-dragon.md). 

Vertissians value harmony and life. As such, they despise bloody conflict.
