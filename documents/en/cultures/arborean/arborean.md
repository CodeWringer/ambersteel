# Arborean
Arboreans are perhaps one of the most mysterious peoples of the old world. Humans barely know anything about them, as they are hidden away, deep in the forest, and only rarely leaving their sanctum. 

They fiercely protect the [Elder Woods](../../../world/berennia/elder-woods) - their home - and keep the [Creeping Death](../../../bestiary/horrors/creeping-death) and intruders out of the woods.  

## Personality
Arboreans are patient, wise, reserved and polite. 

They can be surprisingly territorial, as they will do anything in their power to keep intruders out of the [Elder Tree](../../bestiary/magical/elder-tree)'s woods.

Much of their time is spent patrolling the forest or watching strategic locations therein. That time is also spent wondering and pondering, as they are quite curious about the world and life in general. They frequently ponder the meaning of their existence. 

They hoard knowledge and aim to accumulate as much as possible. They'll frequently come together to share what they've learned. To that end, they also sometimes leave their forest, although not very far and only a few times per century. 

While they possess an impeccable memory regarding their fellow Arboreans, they have a hard time retaining theoretical knowledge. This is why they can become quite anxious to capture their knowledge in whatever way possible, as quickly as possible. They'll also want to return that knowledge to the [Elder Tree](../../bestiary/magical/elder-tree) as soon as they can. 

They generally feel great anxiety, regarding their existence. They feel there must be some greater purpose for them to fulfill and they haven't yet found out what that might be. 

## Social Interactions
Arboreans are fairly social and they enjoy their congregations. 

### Family
They don't know family as humans would. To them, family is all of nature and their parent is the [Elder Tree](../../bestiary/magical/elder-tree). Everyone of their kin is like a sibling to them. 

### Events
Gatherings occur, whenever an Arborean has learned some crucial piece of information, that they feel the urgent need to share with the others. That piece of knowledge is then captured and collected, in the form of small green orbs that are offered to the [Elder Tree](../../bestiary/magical/elder-tree). 

### Behavioral Norms
They consider it polite to share a tale or a piece of knowledge when they first meet a new face. 

### Social Status
Social status is an alien concept to Arboreans. There is no hierarchy, only their undying love for their parent, the [Elder Tree](../../bestiary/magical/elder-tree), who they revere like a god. 

## Fashion
Fashion is difficult to describe for Arboreans, as their "fashion" mostly stems from how they choose to grow it, as an extension of their bodies. 

They distinguish themselves with carefully chosen growths. Some may choose to grow branches with differently colored leaves on them, others may be covered in wildly blooming flowers. Some prefer intricate patterns in their bark or moss growing on their back. Some will even go to the effort of collecting shiny and smooth rocks to frame in roots growing from their back. 

## Hygiene
They will keep pests and parasites out of their bark, but dirt and grime barely have any meaning to them, unless of course, if it impacts their ["fashion"](#Fashion).

## Music and Art
Music is the song of birds. 

To them, art is the natural growth of the plants around them. They may choose to foster certain types of plants or stem the sprawl of others. 

## Writing
Arboreans do not possess writing in the traditional sense. Instead of writing down knowledge, they rely on entrapping it in green memory holding orbs. 

## Morality and Ethics
They will not harm animals or people, unless absolutely necessary. Scaring intruders off is the preferred way of dealing with them, but persistent invaders will be fought back. 

In general, Arboreans are kind-hearted and see all life as valuable and important, worthy of preservation. They also understand the natural cycle and will not intervene with predators on the hunt. But killing for sport is absolutely unnacceptable and will be punished in kind. 

## Spirituality
They revere the [Elder Tree](../../bestiary/magical/elder-tree) as a god. It is both their parent and the giver of life, the holder of knowledge and the one who will deliver them from their confused existence. 

## World View
Most Arboreans are oblivious of most of the world beyond their forest. They believe the world is flat and infinitely deep, so that the [Elder Tree](../../bestiary/magical/elder-tree)'s roots might always have room to grow. 

## Names
They choose their names as they choose their appearance. They have no first or last names, only the one name that corresponds to their ["fashion"](#Fashion).
