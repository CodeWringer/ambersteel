# Zakkeian
Zakkeian culture is centered around the interests of the hive. Co-operation and respect is key to zakkeian life. 

Unlike humans, they consider not themselves and their own well-being first, but rather that of their peers. Being a species of a semi-hive-mind, they never developed a strong sense of egoism, which often puts them at odds with the other peoples, who fail to understand them. 

However, zakkeians are stubborn and slow to adapt. This, coupled with their long lifetimes causes a high cultural inertia.

* Zakkeians wear a surprising amount of cloth, considering they see little practical value in it. However, it is common practice for apprentices to thank their masters or to honor those of great responsibility by gifting them cloth in the colors of their burden.

Jewelry serves as an even greater form of praise and reverence. Colored gemstones, also following the rules of color associations are valuable gifts.

### Manners

* They speak only, when they have something meaningful to say. They will listen for others to finish speaking and make sure to pay attention. Resources are freely shared, guests treated like friends and goals are pursued co-operatively. 
* Despite their openness, they are not naive. They will be guarded against strangers and probe their intentions. They will defend themselves against foes and they will rationally weigh threats. But it will always be for the good of their people. 
* They prefer to outmaneuver and outwit opponents, or if need be, to overwhelm them with magic. Generally though, they will tend to avoid conflict altogether as it is not in their nature to seek it.

## Arts & Aesthetics
* Zakkeian music is not so much music in the human sense, to whom it would seem completely alien. It is a strange melody of mandible scraping and humming at alternating pitch and rythm, that might almost seem pleasant to human ears, were it not so raspy. 
* Zakkids keep detailed records of all their collective knowledge in large library chambers, in the form of carved abyssalite slabs. Touching the slabs and letting a subtle air of magic flow through, magically conveys the memories entrapped therein to the caster.
  
## Entertainment
* Competitions barely take place in zakkeian society. If not in the context of the [Congregation of Skills](#Congregation-of-Skills), there is little reason to compete with each other. As such, innovation rarely takes place, as there is barely any push for it. 
* Most commonly, innovation is brought by outsiders, most notably human scholars who visit the hives out of curiosity. At least, that's how it was before the trek through [Berennia](../../../world/berennia/berennia) became too dangerous. 
* Sunbathing and philosophizing together are popular pastimes, as well as craftsmanship and artistry. It is not uncommon for Zakkids to be actively looking for apprentices to pass their skills on to. Likewise, most Zakkids will be on a constant quest for knowledge. Masters take great pride in the successes of their apprentices and their apprentices will gratefully accept all knowledge. 
* Instead of taverns, they meet, talk and feast together in the numerous great halls that connect underways, which is also where they organize most common activities and just generally socialize.
