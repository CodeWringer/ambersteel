# Culture of the Hive of The Wing
[See Zakkeian culture](../zakkeian)

The hive of the wing still suffers from a few of the follies of youth, as theirs is the youngest hive and their queen has many mistakes yet to learn from. 

## [Worship of the Great Winged Scarab](../../religions/winged-scarab-worship)
Unique to this hive, is their reverence of the winged scarabs, that inhabit the surface of their continent. They see these creatures as harbingers of their queen's magnificence, whose image they imitate. The queen even keeps a few of them around as pets and many spires have balconies, where offerings of food attract these little critters. 

## Music and Art
Most art features the great winged scarab. Pottery, statues, slabs and every day items bear the great winged scarab, next to their queen's magnificence.
