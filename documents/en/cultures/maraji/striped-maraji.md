# Striped-Maraji
The Striped-Maraji primarily inhabit the southern coast of the [Irnolian](../../../world/irnolia/irnolia) continent. If the Nekhanians were to be likened to the sun, then the Striped-Maraji should be likened to the moon. They are the very antithesis to nekhanian culture. 

Their name stems from their Striped-like stripes they cultivate through selective breeding. 

## Personality
Loud, boisterous, authoritative, egotistical, playful and lazy - that describes most Striped-Maraji quite well. 

They are almost always looking for ways to enrich themselves or to keep their competitors down. 

Yet all these negative traits are opposed by their rather playful and almost cheery nature. As long as they don't perceive you as a threat, nor as below them, they will treat you like an honored guest and gladly be polite and playful. 

## Social Interactions

### Family
Males being the authoritative gender, they get to choose multiple females and enjoy absolute power within the family. 

Knowing that female births are far more prevalent, males are urged to have as many children as possible and are forced to either cast out or kill their female children, if they have too many. 

### Events

### Behavioral Norms

### Social Status
Unlike in nekhanian society, females in Striped-Maraji society are treated like property. They can simply not stand up to the far stronger males and their number is kept in check. 

Aside from the gender inequality, social status is determined and expressed by the usual factors, such as wealth, physical prowess or a position of power.

Males not born with stripes are considered ugly and thus treated poorly. Sometimes, such males may even be driven from their homes and expelled from society. With females, children without stripes are usually killed off right away, so as to prevent 'filthy nekhanian fur' to corrupt their society. 

Magic favors those born for higher purpose. Powerful mages enjoy an inherently high social standing, even if they're not otherwise well off.

## Fashion
Males predominantly wear functional clothing. Strong cloth or leather, almost like armor made from soft materials. They adorn themselves with gaudy jewelry and polished gold. 

Diadems might be gifted to prized and valued females, by the more kind-hearted Striped-Maraji. The diadem, being a symbol of nekhanian females, also serves as a symbol, a stand-in for Striped-Maraji world views. 

## Hygiene
Hot baths are reserved for the males, who also get to command their females to groom their fur on demand. And the grooming is an important part of the daily routine. Maraji hate having dirt and parasites in their fur. 

The females must be content with grooming each other, whenever they're not busy with the household. 

## Music and Art
Art isn't exactly well regarded in Striped-Maraji society and so there isn't much domestic art. One can mostly find graffiti with immature themes. Statues, paintings or showy clothes are imported and rare. 

Striped-Maraji are a society focused on pragmatism, where art and music are mostly seen as a waste of time. 

## Writing
Striped-Maraji generally possess written language and share an alphabet. They prefer thin paper as a medium and use ink to write. They use wax seals that prominently feature morbid symbology. 

## Cuisine
Meat, fish and strong spices are a must for all Striped-Maraji. Females are generally allowed less meat and are instead forced to eat bread or vegetables. 

## Morality and Ethics
The strong survive and the strong rule. That is the essence of Striped-Maraji life. If you can take something by force, then it is your right to do so. 

However, there is also a strong notion of a social ladder and fear keeps the lower-downs from acting up. This way, Striped-Maraji society is actually far less chaotic than one would assume from their personality and ethics. 

It shouldn't come as a surprise that powerful mages also comprise the upper crust of Striped-Maraji society. Magic is not only a tool, but a prerogative and constitutes a  birth-right to rule. 

## Spirituality
Striped-Maraji have abandoned their gods, even actively shunning those who are slaves to their faith. This holds especially true, but is not limited to, their nekhanian counter-parts. 

## World View
The world is flat, the ocean infinite. 

Every other civilization is weak prey, to raid at will. Unless of course, if they're just as strong, then they're to be respected. 

## Sports and Competition
Competition is a big part of society. Anything from tests of strength and endurance to tests of mind and learnedness are frequent occurrences and often take the form of open competitions, where anyone who dares can join in. Losing a competition simply puts people in their place, while the winners can use them to rise higher than their current station. 

## Names
Last names are actually placed before first names, when formally addressing Striped-Maraji. Only among friends is the first name solely used.

First names predominantly feature phonetics centered around "s" "j" or "r" sounds.

The last names of Striped-Maraji usually feature an adjective conveying a notion of strength or intimidation first and are then connected to an aspect of Maraji physique.
