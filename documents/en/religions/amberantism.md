# Amberantism
The worship and glorification of [Amberite](../magic/Amberite) and the condemnation of magic. Amberantism is a wide-spread religious belief that permeates large parts of the [old world](../world/world). Its manifestation is the [Amber Order](../independent-organizations/amber-order), which institutionalizes the religion. 

## Deities
[Amberite](../magic/amberite) itself is all an Amberantist needs. It is the antithesis to chaos and corruption. It is the most beautiful, the most serene and comforting material known to man. 

## Hierarchy
Amberantism itself knows only the difference between its spiritual leader and its followers. There is no strict hierarchy. 

The spiritual leader is the highest ranking member of the [Amber Order](../independent-organizations/amber-order), the so called high judge. 

## Beliefs, Morals, Ethics
Magic is not inherently evil, but few can withstand its corrupting power. No one can resist magic's sinister taint and incredible power. This is why magic must be restrained, chained and exterminated as much as possible, for the good of the world and its people. 

Everything the amberantists do, they do with the conviction that they're protecting all life and the stability of the very fabric of the world itself. 

Their cruelty and vengeance are directed entirely upon those they deem corrupted and evil. This extends to non-magic users, as well. Harsh punishments are meted out, but also opportunities for redemption presented, where appropriate. 

Not all magic users may be aware of their curse. They may yet be redeemed and rid of the corruption. Even those who are farther gone, even they may yet repent and be put to work to the benefit of society, instead. 

### Gunteric's Legend
Ever since Gunteric was wrongly accused struck down, those he helped kept his legend alive. The vial of healing magic he brewed stands as a symbol for the good and holy work magic can do. 

Gunteric's legend is taught to Amberantist, so that they may know to temper their zealotry when facing a mage and not to make wrongful accusations. 

### Alberic's Teachings
Following in Gunteric's footsteps, another mage turned their back on the destructive ways of magic. Instead, they researched peaceful applications, much like Gunteric did. 

Alberic took on many pupils in his time, teaching peaceful aspects of many magical schools, as they are still known, today. 

Unsurprisingly, it didn't take long for the order to hear about him and so came to investigate. By then, the legend of Gunteric was firmly woven into Amberantist teachings. Instead of confronting him, they instead kept watch on him and his students. Alberic and his students worked great miracles, healing the ill and the weak, constructing magnificent fortresses for the people of that land to seek refuge during times of war, keeping the soil fertile and strong and much more. 

So impressed were the order's soldiers, that they, when finally confronting Alberic, trembled with humility. They knew the stories of the great tyrants, of torrents of blood, whirlwinds of bone and cities of death. But contrasting all that stood there, Alberic, giving them an uncertain, but warm smile. They knew they were to put a collar on him, but simply couldn't bring themselves to do so. Instead, they wanted to know why he chose not to join in the other mages' eternal struggle for power. 

He told them, over a cup of tea, the many gruesome and terrible things he had witnessed. There was no regret in his voice, no horror, nor sadness. Instead, there was great fatigue. He also told them stories, of how the few times he cast a smile on someone's face, it filled his heart with so much more warmth than any power he may have once held. 

Shaken by what he told them, the order's soldiers were certain. This was one of the greatest warlords of their time, sitting with them, chatting over a cup of tea. They collared and took him back to an Amberantist outpost, where he was recognized and sentenced to death, for his crimes against humanity. He did not resist, although he certainly would have been able to. 

Alberic's students were left in peace, however, and they upheld his beliefs. Together, they kept up the peaceful study, taking on their own students and thus keeping alive Alberic's teachings. 

This legend is told, to teach about redemption and fairness. 

### Individual's Purpose
It is everyone's duty to fight evil magic. 

### After-Life
Those who serve faithfully return to the [Amber Tree](#The-Amber-Tree) and it ferries them to the after-life. A paradise. 

## Symbolism
A common symbol among Amberantists is the *Amber Tree*, which represents their devotion to purity and order.

Another symbol is *the first collar* - the very first cruel collar put on a mage to impede their ability to control the magic winds. This is usually a symbol of those tasked with hunting and subduing rogue mages. 

The *Vial of Gunteric* represents magic's limited capacity for good deeds. Common among subdued mages and alchemists and their overseers. 

## Rituals and Rites

## Obligations
One must give up their previous life and start a new one within the order. 

## Prayers

## Sacred Items and Sites

### The Amber Tree
The Amber Tree is a giant, majestic, but dead-looking tree, made entirely of the name-giving material. 

It is said that sometimes drops of sap fall from its branches. The very first Amberantist is said to have been hit by one such droplet of sap, which bestowed upon him great regenerative abilities. Upon this they founded amberantist order. So, many pilgrims also come here to pay homage to the nameless founder of the order. 

Many pilgrims seek out the Amber Tree. They wish to be amazed and awed by its majesty and purity, each secretly hoping some tree sap will fall on them. 

### The first collar
[Amberite](../magic/amberite)'s properties of nullifying magic were not known from the beginning of the order. When this was later discovered, the first collar was made, to be locked to the neck of the greatest magical tyrant at the time. 

This artifact is crafted of only the purest [Amberite](../magic/amberite) and is being kept under lock and key, until such a time it may be needed again. 

### The Vial of Gunteric
During the [anti-magic wars](TODO), a powerful mage turned his back on his master and instead offered his services to the order. They refused the mage, yet he insisted. Again, his offer was turned down, but he would not let up so easily, he wanted to set things right and atone for his sins. So sincere was his wish, that the order, instead of executing him on the spot, allowed him to depart unharmed, to find a means of atoning on his own. 

And so he left, wandering the ravaged old world, gathering ingredients. He brewed a potion and wandered the places of misery. He sought out the wounded, sick and dejected and gave them to drink but a drop of the potion. So powerful was it, that only a short while after consumption, it eased all pains, closed all wounds and cured all illnesses. 

After a month had passed, he again met with men of the order. He explained to them how he helped every soul in need he came across, showing the near empty potion vial as proof. Ignorant of his deeds, they shackled him and confiscated the vial. 

A few days later, the order soldiers were ambushed and decimated. Only a few of them made it out alive. When conventional healing methods failed to one of them, he volunteered to test the potion's effect. He drank the last drop the vial held and almost immediately started feeling better. Seeing the truth in the mage's words, the man then sought the mage out, seeking to free him from his unrightful imprisonment. But the others of his order were overzealous and had meted out the ultimate punishment earlier that day. 

He learned the name of the mage from them and kept the vial. And thus he taught all other members of the tragic redemption of Gunteric, whose vial now represents the good that magic can achieve, as well as redemption for terrible deeds. 

## Holdings

### Fortress of the Amber Order
While not the birth place of the [Amber Order](../independent-organizations/amber-order), this fortress stood fast against literal tidal waves of magic flow battering its walls, near the end of the [anti-magic wars](TODO). 

Its walls are lined with fine [Amberite](../magic/amberite), with intricate runes etched into their surface, to nullify a wide variety of magics with great efficiency. 

Once inside, pilgrims are led to the chamber of silence, to be awed by its marble floors, painted walls and ceilings, as well as statues depicting some of the order's greatest champions. 

Aside from serving as the [Amber Order](../independent-organizations/amber-order)'s base of operations and recruiting center, the fortress houses the largest [Amberite](../magic/amberite) storage of the [old world](../world/world). Any [Amberite](../magic/amberite) the order gets a hold of will be stored here, until used. 

### Vault of the Curse
A newer structure than the fortress, the Vault of the Curse was hewn into the side of a mountain, lined with walls of [Amberite](../magic/amberite) and is guarded by the best of the [Amber Order](../independent-organizations/amber-order)'s warriors. 

Deep beneath the mountain lies the vault itself. A massive underground complex, based on a natural cavern system. It houses countless chambers where [Abyssalite](../magic/abyssalite) is stored. Whatever [Abyssalite](../magic/abyssalite) the [Amber Order](../independent-organizations/amber-order) confiscates, ends up here, in one of these chambers. 

No mage is allowed anywhere near the vault and if one is found on the perimeter they'll be put in chains right away.
