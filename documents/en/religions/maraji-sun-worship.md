# Maraji Worship of the Sun
The state-religion of [Nekha](../nations/nekhanian-city-state) and the dominant religion that most [Nekhanian Maraji](../races/Maraji/Maraji) follow. 

## Deities
### The sun
Represents the following: 
* Both giver and taker of life. 
* The warmth that fills the heart. 
* The heat that fuels anger. 

### The moon
The moon is worshipped as the balancing opposite of the sun and is seen as the antithesis to life and represents loneliness. 

## Hierarchy
The *high priestess* represents the spiritual leader of all Maraji, regardless of their origin, social status or nationality. Only the most devout Maraji, who has been in service longer than any other and chosen by the sun itself can perform this duty. 
The high priestess can practically dictate all laws and social norms that Maraji adhere to. It is considered a great honor to be allowed in the presence of the high priestess and even moreso to be spoken to by her. 

Below the high priestess are the *lower priestesses*, whose sole duty is to help the high priestess perform her duties and manage the finances and other organizational tasks. 

*Prayer priests* are the spiritual guidance for local populaces. Unlike the higher duties, males may also perform this duty. 

## Beliefs, Morals, Ethics
At the base of all Maraji belief is that the sun is judging their every action and is waiting for the day when all sin has been vanquished. On that day, the sun will grow merciful and give way for an era of life and utopia. 

Due to their more aggressive nature and fewer numbers, males are regarded the *sons of the moon*. Their higher tendency towards violence makes the females quite reluctant to allow them into positions of power. By contrast, the plentiful females are seen as the *daughters of the sun*, who the sun prefers and loves more than the males. This disparity shows in the social standing of males, which is usually seen as lower than that of females that should be of equal status. 

Sin is anything that might be harmful to others. Cheating on one's life partner, violence and lies and deceit are all actions to be avoided. 

Virtuous is anything that helps others. 

It is considered sinful for a female to take more than one male as their husband and likewise, it is considered a terrible sin for a male to be husband to more than one wife. Marriage is a great honor for males, as it raises their social standing and allows them to finally be virtuous by providing for their wife. It is up to the female whether she wants to treat her husband as her equal, or personal servant. There is no official penalty for either. 

### Individual's Purpose
Every individual has the holy duty to be virtuous and expunge sin wherever possible. 

### After-Life
Females return to the warm embrace of the sun, wheres males are comdemned to the coldness of the moon. 

## Symbolism
The primary symbol is the sun, with its glowing beams of light radiating from it. 

The required antithesis to the sun is the moon, whis is commonly represented by a crescent. 

## Rituals and Rites

## Obligations
Every Maraji has to meet for the early evening prayer. If they cannot make it to a sun plaza, they will have to find a local place suitable to prayer and hold the prayer themselves. 

In order to keep church-owned property well maintained, all Maraji have to either pay a monthly tithe or provide their personal working power. To that end, at the end of every month, when entering the sun plaza, Maraji will be asked to pay the tithe, or sign up for forced labour days. Should a Maraji refuse to either pay the tithe or sign up for work, will they not be allowed to take part in prayers. The other Maraji will take note of that and the social standing of the offending Maraji will plummet as a result. 

Once each year, all Maraji must return to Nekha and take part in the great prayer, with the high priestess herself in attendance. Of course, such an event is the best opportunity for tithes to be collected, helping to sustain Nekha. 

## Prayers
Every Maraji prayer begins by appealing to the sun's mercy, hoping that sin will one day end. The middle of the prayer may vary, based on local needs or recent events. The end is almost always an admonition that the moon seeks to fill the hearts with bitter cold and must not be given in to. 

## Sacred Items and Sites
Nekha is regarded as a holy site. Its natural oasis, in the middle of the desert, represents the sun's capacity for mercy. 

## Places of Worship
Prayer is done in so-called *sun plaza* - large, round plazas surrounded by walls. Docked to the walls are seating opportunities and above those, roofing, usually made from cloth or carpet, shielding from the sun. The larger sun plaza may even have two floors, with one above the other, in the form of wooden balconies. 

For most prayer ceremonies, the seating areas remain completely empty, with all Maraji in attendance sitting on a pillow in the plaza. Standing in the very center of the plaza is the local prayer priest, who all other Maraji are facing and listening to, as he relays news and invites to prayer. 

Marriages are also forged on the plaza, albeit in a much less oppressive atmosphere. There is food and drink, as well as music and dance. 

The seating areas are used whenever a detestable duty has to be performed, such as excommunications or punishments. Then only the prayer priest, a handful of guards and the offender are allowed on the plaza. 

The largest sun plaza in existence is the opulent *eye of the sun* in Nekha, where the high priestess herself performs special prayer duties.
