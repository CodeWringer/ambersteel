# Worship of the Serpent of Arn

## Deities
The great serpent of [Arn](../world/arn/arn), which is really just an ordinary [sea serpent](../bestiary/beasts/sea-serpent), but which is sighted fairly regularly around the coast of [Arn](../world/arn/arn). 

It is believed the great serpent gave life to the world, just as it takes away life from those who fail to appease it well. 

## Hierarchy
There are priests and novices. The priests do the actual preaching and take care of spiritual guidance, while the novices only help with the menial tasks of groundskeeping or temple maintenance. 

## Beliefs, Morals, Ethics
The great Serpent of Arn must be appeased, or its wrath will befall your next voyage. Tithes of coin, food or plunder, sometimes even blood sacrifice, all work. 

### Individual's Purpose
Everyone has to do their part to appease the great serpent. If even one sailor hasn't done that, the entire boat goes down. In that sense, it's common practice to blame bad omens or mishaps on another not having paid their tithe. 

### After-Life

## Symbolism
Depictions of the great Sea Serpent of Arn. 

## Rituals and Rites
It is customary for the deceased to be sent out to sea on small barges, so they may return to the great serpent, from whence life stems. 

## Obligations
Every sailor must make regular sacrifices, which are sent out to sea on barges which are rigged to burn down out on the open sea, so that no sinners may be able to steal the tributes to the great serpent. 

## Prayers
It is customary for sailors or their wives to silently pray at shore, usually before or after a voyage, either appeasing or thanking the great serpent for safe passage.
