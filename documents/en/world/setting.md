# Setting
Magic was once commonplace. The greatest leaders of that time were the greatest magic-users, as well as greatest tyrants. Their power was consuming and corrupting. Just shy of tearing the world apart, they were stopped by the Amber Order. 

The tyranny of magic was ended over fifteen hundred years ago and while its aftereffects still echo through time in a myriad of ways, the end of the medieval period now draws close, as gunpowder and steam are being researched, with breakthroughs within reach. Such technologies will surely revolutionize warfare in the old world. 

The old world, as the original continent is commonly referred to, mostly mirrors a late-medieval europe of the real world. However, it is not a clear mirror. There are no real world nations or people, but aspects of them have been borrowed from. 

Just a few years ago, the new world was discovered, far to the west, where none dared venture before. But with the strange vanishing of the titan that controlled those waters, passage to the west has become possible. 

Now many of the world's great leaders live fever-dreams of their own empires. However, the new world is completely unexplored and none can tell what great dangers or treasures it may hold. 

At the dawn of this new era, the old world's leaders yearn to achieve greatness and topple the existing order. As war looms on the horizon, as endless hordes of undead and the corruption smash against the last bastions of civilization. The future was rarely as uncertain.
