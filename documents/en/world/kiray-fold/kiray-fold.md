# Kiráy Föld
Not following naming conventions of [The Old Empire](../../nations/historical/human/old-empire), this peninsula was named by the [Kirlennians](../../nations/human/kirlennian-empire) that make their home there since the days of the magic wars. 

There is a transition of a warmer, drier climate in the south to a more temperate climate towards the northern half, where most arable land is used for agriculture and forestry. 

To the north-east the peninsula touches upon the mountain range called the [Thorn Ridge](../veerdhart/thorn-ridge).
