# Great Wounds of the World
The gigantic chasms that lead deep into the earth's crust have been named the great wounds of the world. No one has been all the way down and most who try either never return or call off their expedition quickly. 

There is talk of horrible noises, like dying animal screams, rising up from the darkest pits. Legend has it, this is where the monsters that stalk the world come from. 

The [Creeping Death](../bestiary/horrors/creeping-death) rises out of the depths. If not kept in check, it threatens to consume the world. 

The great wounds are the primary source of [Abyssalite](../magic/abyssalite), which mages seek to exploit.
