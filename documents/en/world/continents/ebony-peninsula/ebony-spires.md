# Ebony Spires
This ancient mountain range displays a mix of smooth cliffs and gentle valleys, as well as tall, jagged spires and treacherous mountain treks. 

Several earthquakes and a few volcano eruptions have shaken any attempts made by humans to settle there over the past millenia. 

Name-giving to these mountains are the remnants of the eruptions. Large fields of exposed obsidian, polished by the rain over the course of centuries. Commonly hidden amidst the obsidian are [Abyssalite](../../magic/abyssalite) shards, brought to surface by the volcanos.
