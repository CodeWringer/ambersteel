You breathe heavily, with the fate of the world on your shoulders and steel on your bones. Nervously, you open your visor. There, on the other side, stretches out an army of corpses. Many of them your comrades, not too long ago. Towering above them, stands a man, in robes. Their deep red is complemented by chains and amulets of black metal. 

Suddenly, something heavy pats you on the shoulder. You turn around to see a man's gauntlet-covered hand retract and a reassuring smile from him - "Don't worry, brother. I'll be your shield, against all terrors and manner of monstrosity. You know this." Strapped to his other arm, is a large rectangular shield. It's almost glowing from all the bright, fiery orange metal lining its face. 

But you have little time to admire the color. He forcefully spins you around, flicks down your visor and says, "You don't have to worry about a thing. All you have to. do. IS. CHAAAARGE!" 

Along with his, the deafening noise of a hundred voices all cry out, next to you, behind you - it's all around! Almost against your will, you start moving and accelerating, as bodies, a hundred ranks deep push you onward. Whether from the adrenaline or fear, you roar your fiercest, like all the rest. 

As you get closer, the stench assaults you ahead of the enemy lines. But the charge is in full motion and nothing will stop it now. Before you crash into the enemy line, you catch one last glimpse of your foe - standing almost bored atop his mountain of bone and flesh. 

With every body you cleave, your weapon glows brightly, the magic in these wretched bodies sparking within your **Ambersteel** with gleeful satisfaction. You cut your way through the enemy ranks, until finally, you see a path leading to the necromancer. 

"BROTHER!", a voice shouts behind you, their heavy hand yanking you back forcefully. Instinctively, you huddle behind your shieldbrother's **Ambersteel** tower-shield. A torrent of fire shoots out towards you. You hear the screams and wretch at the stench of burning flesh. But you don't have time to put out your comrades - the path is clear and your shieldbrother is advancing. You follow him, cutting down any ghosts of flame who stumble too close. 

You peek over the shield and see him there, frothing in tormented hatred and anger. Again, magic shoots out from him, but the raw power of thunder and lightning splashes harmlessly against the shield. He screams in pain and a miasma of death engulfs the mountain. But its magic is harmless against your shield. 

He is close now! You rush forward, with one final cry slashing at the now defenseless tyrant. His body collapses and you watch the head roll down, into the fire and death, where it joins the ranks of his collapsing troops.

The storyteller finishes, saying, "And that's when he earned the title of *Amberite Kijser*. He was but a boy then and truly, no one knows if he really even did it. But one thing is certain. Over one thousand years ago, in that pivotal battle against evil, our world was freed from the tyranny of magic!"

You're certain the storyteller embellished the story and can't help but wonder how much of it is actually real. Interest in these old stories certainly seems to have risen again, since *Innilreith* - the so-called "Realm of Lords" - announced itself to the world. 

Atop its hierarchy stands a necromancer, proclaiming the return of magic and an end to tyranny of **Amberite**. Will history repeat itself? Will there be more legends of heroes made? 

Considering the options, now might be the best time to become a legend. A new world lies to the west, its gate-keeping *titan* having vanished without a trace. The *Creeping Death* engulfs the north-east. Rumors have it, the Kirlennians are preparing for war and many speculate on their victory. And of course, *Innilreith* consumes the south-east, with the *Amber Order* gearing up for a war of their own - against magic. 

Just where shall we begin? Well, perhaps with this tankard.
