# Berennia
The north-eastern part of the [old world](../world), conjoining the [Ebony Peninsula](../ebony-peninsula/ebony-peninsula), [Veerdhart](../veerdhart/veerdhart), [Zaetrippa](../Zaetrippa/Zaetrippa) and [Irnolia](../Irnolia/Irnolia) is Berennia. A land where civilization has always been sparse, thus letting large, dark forests sprawl and the vast tundra remain mostly untouched. 

Now, the [creeping death](../../bestiary/horrors/creeping-death) covers most of the continent.
