# Plane of The Dead
Very little is known about the Plane of The Dead and its existence remains unproven, but is generally assumed to be where souls go, once their hosts expire. 

It is assumed that the Plane of The Dead is covered in eternal darkness and represents an infinite expanse, where souls wander aimlessly. Escape from it is only possible through [soul-binding](../ruleset/magic/magic-schools#soul-binding) and the soul in question cannot remember anything about its time in the Plane of The Dead. 

The longer a soul spends on the Plane of The Dead, the farther it wanders.
