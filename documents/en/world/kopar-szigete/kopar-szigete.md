# Kopár Szigete
A large island off the coast of [Kiráy Föld](../kiray-fold/kiray-fold). 

Several sharp mountains jut out of the ocean, active volcanoes tipping a few of the peaks. 

The land is barely arable, due to mostly being covered in ash and obsidian. 

Seismic activity is common, here.
