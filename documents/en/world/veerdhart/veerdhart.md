# Veerdhart
The center of the old and civilized world and its beating heart, is called Veerdhart 

## Ruggengraat Mountains
This massive mountain range cuts the old world into two halves. The name stems from its shape, that cartographers found, looks reminiscent of a spine. 

It is an ancient mountain range and so loses much of its edge towards the outer spurs and lower mountains. At its foot to the west lies a line of rolling, gentle hills whereas the east has many sharp and high cliff faces. 

Even though there are well-trodden paths over it, one should not underestimate the perils of a journey to the other side. Landslides, extreme cold at the higher elevations and nesting grounds of numerous predators have cost many an adventuruous merchant their life.
