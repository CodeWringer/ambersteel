# The Night That Would Not Die
> You find yourselves in the streets of the great metropolis of **Virgivyé**, the capital of the great tsardom of **Zdrány**. While how you ended up here is a story of your own to tell, you find yourselves painfully short on time to tell it, as your thoughts are cut short by **FIRE** RAINING FROM THE **SKY**! 
>
> The city stands in flames! Nearly every house seems to have caught fire, their prior inhabitants stand, run and cower in the streets in blind panic. 
> 
> Quick! Save what you can from the inferno! But as you turn around, your sight is blinded by your prior staying-place **blazing** like a star! You see glimpses of men rushing by, trying desperately to wash the flames away, but to no avail! 
> 
> And then you hear it - a *gurgling roar* of something not of this world. You're getting a front row seat to the spectacle of abominations emerging from the sewer grates, bursting the iron rebar like they were twigs in a storm and devouring and dismembering all living things around you. 
> 
> As screams of pain and terror flood the streets around you, there can be no more doubt. The *once* idle threats of a madman have become **reality**. The civilized world shall burn and its people shall feed *the tyranny of magic* once more. 
> 
> You need to get out! Out of the city! But you won't manage, alone. Gather survivors and find a way out - or lie down in the growing mounds of ash and blood. 

## Premise
This scenario is very much intended as a "prequel" of sorts, to the actual current timeline of **Ambersteel's** universe. 

The goal of the players is to leave the gargantuan metropolis of **Virgivyé** in the fastest way possible. Every moment spent losing time should increase the threat of them being spotted and singled out in the chaos. 

Whether they actually make it out or not, is not guaranteed. It should depend strongly on their decisions. Play the heros and endanger themselves or leave warm bodies behind as distraction, to buy time with? A moral conundrum for your players to face. 

If they cannot leave the city by dawn (the scenario starts off at midnight), they'll most likely never get out, as that is the point when the city is entirely surrounded and besieged by undead. You can still let them find a way to break through the siege, for example by way of the massive underground sewer system. But it should be ***hard***. 

Start the scenario off by making the players meet, *somehow*. They could simply meet in the streets, perhaps one-by-one being introduced to the group. Or you could have them start off as a group already, if they prefer. 

## Threats
First and foremost, the city is a blazing inferno. **Flame** threatens to devour all, as this ancient city consists of countless narrow roads and tightly-packed wooden buildings. 

Then, there's the **undead**, pouring out of the plentiful underground places. Most are simple thralls, which pose a threat only in number. But then there are several war-beasts, specifically sewn together to comprise the effective and horrific shock-troops of the invasion force. 

Hell is other **people**, as they say. Not everyone's mind is set on mere survival. Many forget their morals and aim to enrich themselves in the chaos. Bandits, looters and murderers roam free, blissfully unaware of their inevitable and painful doom. 

**Three mages** roam the streets of the city. They control the undead and make fire rain from the sky. They've exhausted themselves already, but among them is the great necromancer **Mengk Kovskidrany**. Even exhausted, he is a foe of immeasurable and terrifying power! The players **can not** survive a direct confrontation with him!

The entire city is surrounded by a **moat**. Spikes rest below its surface. Anyone foolish enough to jump in will be perforated by multiple iron spikes. 

The **river** that runs through the city is tainted with something **poisonous** to the touch. 

## Metropolis of Virgivyé
The city itself is a centuries old conglomerate of old and new city quarters, tightly interwoven and labyrinthian in nature. 

### Landmarks
These landmarks both serve as points of orientation, as well as minor scenarios of their own, each with their own moral quandries, hostilities and drama. 

#### The River
A large river divides the city in two. Dozens of large and several smaller bridges span its breadth. These days, the water runs red and is poisonous to the touch. Swimming is ill-advised! 

Those with boats are hastily making their escape and while some succeed, the besiegers have thought of escape by river and begun blocking off the down and upstream entrances to the city. The city itself is providing the material for the construction of two grotesque dams - the citizens themselves, as well as their former dwellings. 

#### Town Hall
In the center of the city stand the proud and ornate walls of the town hall. The chancellor and his cohort of bureaucrats are hiding behind a detachment of city guards desperately trying to hold off the undead beasts beset on them. 

These honorable fools are trying to protect the state archives within. Valuable treatises and writs of allegiance are stored in the vault. The bureaucrats are trying to get to the vault, but the stairs to it are buried beneath rubble and they're hardly strong enough to clear the way in time. The guards can't help as they're too busy fending for their lives. 

These treatises are valuable, however! If they could be brought out of the city, allies could be called to arms. The chancellor sees it as her duty to see these parchments taken to safety. Will the players aid them? There is no immediate reward, except for the friendly loyalty of the city's officials. 

#### Temple
A large temple devoted to the gods stands as a bulwark against the undead. Its militant inhabitants are templars and other such *holy* warriors. They have begun gathering survivors, patching them up and preparing them for an attempted break-out of the city. 

But they're not strong enough to keep everyone safe. And there are unsavory characters triyng to benefit of the chaos. These thieves and thugs are extorting what little money and few heirlooms people were able to save from the flames, while the templars are busy holding back undead and looking for survivors. 

The players may chance upon one such holy warrior, who'll attempt to recruit them to their retinue of temple-defenders. 

If the players decide to help, they'll be sent to find and rescue survivors. This may put them dangerously close to their time-limit. The various survivors might reward them and the templars will do their utmost to protect the players and help them get out. 

#### Merchant-District
A fairly small city quarter, especially known for its large variety of settled merchants, offering wares of all kinds, from all places of the known world. 

Looters are currently making off with anything they deem valuable, while knocking their owners' teeth loose or worse, cutting their throat. 

The players could join in the pillage or put a stop to it. The merchants would reward them with supplies and a particularly rare gift - a blade of pure **Ambersteel**! Such a weapon would be an unfathomable asset in the fight against the undead. The players won't receive such a reward if they simply take the supplies by force. 

#### Tsar-Monument
The ancient and aging monument of the founding tsar stands as a tall landmark close to the main thoroughfare.

#### Red-Moon Inn
The Red-Moon inn is an establishment of some renown. It once served the upper class rare vintages and exquisite dishes. Now, it serves only dead men. 

But there are rumors that this place is connected to the extensive sewer system that runs beneath the city. Perhaps the barman is still alive? He might know how to navigate the subterranean labyrinth. 

#### Western Slums
Near the western city wall lie the western slums. Things were bad enough before the invasion, but now the misery here permeates the very air itself. 

At least the flames are so thick here that no undead could possibly lurk here. But the desperate inhabitants of these squalored streets might prove a challenge of their own. Perhaps they could be reasoned with? Better watch your back, though, just to be sure. 

#### The Mausoleum
Many tsars of old have decided to make **Virgivyé** their final resting place. The isolated building stands free of flame, but the miasma of death is overwhelming here. 

Many undead roam this area, apparently streaming out of the large mausoleum building. But there are less busy ways inside and surely it can't contain many undead, if there are this many already outside?

#### The Bastion
The bastion is the main place of city guard operations. And while its walls have only taken minor damage, many guardsmen are out in the city. With its current garrison, the bastion may fall within only a few short hours! 

Its armory is blessed to contain a shield of pure **Ambersteel**, which the captain of the guard has locked away. In his eyes, its symbolic value is too great to risk losing it. If he could somehow be convinced to relinquish it, its protective qualities against magic would be a great asset. 

The players may help by finding and rescuing as many guardsmen as they can and returning them to the bastion. The city guard won't flee the city, but they'll help the players cut a path through the undead until they reach the city gates. 

#### The Main Thoroughfare
The only truly large road that leads through the city in a large arc is reminiscent of a battle-line. Its cobbled stone is tainted with crimson all the way through and is the stage of many skirmishes and slaughters. 

Following it would lead the players out of town the most direct and straight-forward way possible, but they'll be facing countless undead and may even run across one of the **necromancers** controlling the invasion force. 

Dozens of abandoned wagons and their cargo, as well as the beasts of burden litter the road. It may in fact be possible to use the blanket of smoke and cover of fallen wagons to sneak out of town. 

#### South-Western Gate
The south-western city gate is the more modern installation. It boasts a drawbridge with moat, iron portcullis and gate-house with modern mechanisms that allow effortlessly raising or lowering the bridge. Any engineering-type player character would know this information, which is relevant because both the drawbridge is raised and the portcullis shut. 

If the mchanism could be triggered, it would be the easiest way out of the city. But inside the gatehouse lurk especially tough undead. The disembowled corpses of several guardsmen strewn about warn of its presence. 

#### South-Eastern Gate
This gate has completely collapsed. Normal passage is impossible. 

The rubble seems to still be burning, even without any fuel. A magically fuelled flame is in the way. 

#### Northern Gate
The nothern city gate is also referred to as the "old gate". While it lacks a drawbridge or portcullis, it has thick wooden gates that can be shut from the inside. 

It appears as though some mass of flesh and bone is keeping the gates shut. It may be possible to burn this abomination, but that may attract attention and take a while. A more elegant solution would be to dissolve it. 

Luckily, the apothecary's quarter isn't far. 

#### Apothecary's Quarter
The apothecary's quarter is aptly named, as it contains dozens of shops selling herbs, medical supplies, surgeon's tools and less overtly, alchemical supplies. 

The fire has hit this quarter pretty hard, though and there isn't much time to peruse the wares. Savvy player character's can find alchemical supplies to concoct an effective acid to quietly burn away the growth blocking the nothern gate. The acid won't work quickly though, thus limiting its potential offensive use. 

#### The Great Library
One of the oldest buildings in town, the Great Library is host to parchments, scrolls and books pertaining a wide field of knowledge. That alone won't rouse the interest of someone looking to get out of the city. But if the players come across it, a citizen outside will hail them and beg them to rescue their friend whose trapped inside. 

They themselves have a broken leg and thus can't do it themselves. If the players agree, they'll have to act quickly, to find the trapped friend somewhere in the bowels of the large, but disintegrating building. 

If they find them in time, they'll have to free them from some rubble. With combined strength, they should be able to lift the smoldering wooden beam that's trapped the man underneath. 

Perceptive players may notice a silver broach laying nearby. Especially knowledgable characters will know this to be the identifying mark of the secretive **Mechanite Order**. If they confront him about it, the man will admit to being a mechanite. 

If they help him get to safety outside, both he and his friend will tell the players of a secret mechanite workshop not far from the library. If they help both men get there safely, they'll open the way and disable the guardian-type automaton inside. From there, they send them through a relatively safe section of the sewers. The mechanites will remain in the workshop, insisting that their work cannot be allowed to go to waste. 

#### The Mechanite Workshop
Not far from the Great Library, a secret mechanite workshop is hidden in the basement of a stone-mason house. The building stands out, because few other buildings around are made of stone. As such, it is standing in good enough shape to investigate. 

Very perceptive and engineering-savvy characters can find a way inside the hidden workshop. Inside are many complex and alien machines, laying dormant. 

However, one machine is chugging on. It is a guardian-type automaton. An eight-legged spider-bot powered by steam, its interiors bristling with several differently glowing metal mechanisms and clock-works. 

A locked door leads out of the workshop and into the sewer system. 

#### The Opera House
A large, half-round building with a cobbled plaza surrounding it serves as a hideout for many survivors. 

#### The Stairs-Quarter
The stairs-quarter is named after its many stairs. The already very narrow alleys are a further challenge due to the many steps and large variance in height. 

Once something of a tourist attraction, this quarter is now a labyrinth of death. But perhaps that could be of advantage? It would be easy to lose one's enemies in these winding passages. 

#### Father Elias' Hospital
Father Elias may not be doctor, nor know the first thing about medicine, but he will tend to anyone knocking on his door. Over time, his drive to help has attracted the like-minded. 

They moved from the infirmary wing of a church to their own building, dedicated to the treatment and care of the sick. 

And yet, even before tonight, people tended to avoid the hospital. Sickness and helplessness are a stigma many wouldn't willingly attract. 

Now, the place reeks of death. Whether from the lack of care, or the invasion of carcasses, you can be sure to find even more cold bodies here. But then again, medical supplies are hard to come by and the hospital is known to stock many. Better hope the fire doesn't get to them, first. 

## Encounters
This is a (non-exhaustive) selection of possible encounters for the players to face. 

### Citizens Stuck in a Burning House
Screams for help from a burning house may alert the players that someone is inside. 

Inside are three terrified children, a lightly wounded mother, their grandmother and an unconscious, heavily burned husband. 

The front door is stuck, a fallen wooden beam has blocked it from the outside. The windows are too small for anyone to climb through. 

If and once freed, they'll want to get out, just as everyone else. The've nothing to reward the players with, but are grateful for the rescue. 

If the players simply move on, they'll be rewarded with heavy banging and more panicked screams for help that morph into screams of incredible pain and agony. 

### Citizens cornered by the undead
Screams and roars from a nearby alley may alert the players that someone nearby is being threatened by the invaders. 

This should only be a mild encounter, depending on the PCs' remaining strength. Helping the citizens, they are rewarded with medical supplies. Failing to help the citizens or arriving late, to scavenge the leftovers, reveals the tattered and unusable remains of the medical supplies. 

### A mother in search of her child
As they make their way through the narrow streets, a woman will rush out of one of the side alleys and bump into one of the PCs. She will ask them, frantically, if they've seen her child. She lost her little Emily around here, somewhere. They were separated when her husband was attacked. She doesn't know why anyone would attack her dear Tarkin. 

If the PCs agree to help, they'll have to search the nearby alleyways. In one of them, they find a wounded little girl cowering behind some rubble. It's only a light wound - slight burns and scratches. As they carry or lead her out, two zombies lunge at them from where they came from. 

Once dispatched or avoided, the PCs can safely return the child to her mother, who will take her and run towards the temple. The PCs may tag along or try to find their own path. 

### Guards escorting survivors
A small precession of guards and several survivors is carefully making its way through the streets. They're heading towards the bastion, where they're rounding up survivors, to try and keep them safe. 

The PCs are free to tag along, or find their own path. 

### Bone-Spider ambush
Once the PCs enter of the narrower streets, they find three guardsmen there, carefully advancing through the rubble. As their heads spin to face the PCs, surprised to see them, they're suddenly assaulted by two [bone-spiders](bestiary/../../../../bestiary/undead/bone-spider.md). 

The PCs can choose to aid them or to avoid the fight. 

One of the guardsmen is a capable healer and will patch up any wounds of anyone who particiapted in the fight. 

### The Rat-Catcher
A slimy-looking fellow. The rat-catcher is well known in these parts. He's got a dirty and sly smile, a lazy eye and a dirty leather belt diagonally strapped over his shoulder. Rats are tied to it by their tails. 

This is the rat-catcher. He knows these alleys, most peoples' basements and even parts of the sewers. But he won't share his secrets. In fact, he barely speaks a straight sentence, instead resorting to oddly hinting at his intentions and licking his lips. He is very overtly a weirdo. 

Violence won't make him yield any information, instead making him squeal like a rat and boggling his eyes in panic. He's clearly not sane. Perhaps it is violence like this, done unto him in the past, that made him so. Regardless, the most use the players will get out of him, is if they can tail him, without him noticing. He will unknowingly lead them through the alleys, closer to one of the city gates. This way, the PCs can avoid some of the worse streets. 

If at any point he notices them, he will squeal and run away in a blind panic. Somewhere along the way, he is guaranteed to notice them and flee. It would be quite hard for the players to keep chasing him. If they do catch him, he won't be of any use, see the point about violence above. 

### The Cat Lady
A middle-aged lady stands outside her burning home. She's crying and worried sick. 

When the PCs catch her attention, she'll stop them, even throw herself at them, if needed, and beg them to go rescue her little babies. The woman can offer no reward. 

If they agree, they'll have to enter the building, somehow. Flame seeks to consume all and endangers the PCs' lives. Attentive and nimble PCs may be able to spot and pilfer some silver tableware. 

The "little babies" are in the basement. It's a pack of well-cared for looking albino rats. At the far back wall, there is a flight of steep stairs, leading up to a locked hatch double door. The PCs have to catch the rats first, if they want to "rescue" them. There are small metal cages around, in which any caught rats can be held. 

### The Curious Plague Doktor
In one of the alleyways, a masked man in a shoddy top hat is crouched over a mangled body, taking samples of blood with a nasty-looking syringe. 

This is an odd fellow, who will ask the players for a *small* favor. He wants a *live* sample of undead flesh. He suspects something beyond necromancy at work, but finds himself incapable of acquiring it, on his own. He would accompany the PCs to a nearby alley, where he heard gurgles and uncoordinated foot falls. Several tougher undead are clawing on the doors of the houses there. The PCs will have to grapple and hold one of them long enough for the plague doktor to take his sample. 

If they agree, as advance payment, he'll hand them an alchemical potion. As reward, he promises two more potions. 

If the players try to take the potions by force, he'll use smoke bombs to disengage, run and hide in the alleys. The players can chase him with a successful, very hard observation test. He'll also use alchemical potions to detonate parts of the buildings around, to block passage to him. He's a slippery fellow...

### Wounded citizens in an alley protected by an Amberantist
As they pass by an alley, the PCs may notice an armed and armored individual standing guard. When he notices them, he commands them to help, in the name of the holy amber tree. 

There are several wounded citizens cowering in the alley behind him. He needs help getting them to safety, at the temple. 

The Amberantist would be a scary sight to any mage among the PCs. He would swear death upon all mages, regardless of their intentions. They're all corrupted and foul and must not be allowed to fester. 

If the PCs agree, they may be able to escort the citizens or find stray guardsmen to enroll convince to help, instead. 

### A Scholar in Need
An intellectual, wearing a fancy vest and feathered hat, is currently busy trying to calm their mule. Leather saddle bags are laying nearby, seemingly intended for the mule's back. But the animal is freaked out and won't let anyone near. 

The animal is too small to ride and won't help the PCs get out faster. Its use is only for carrying the personal library of the intellectual. 

If the PCs can help calm the animal, the scholar will tell them of a relatively close way into the sewers. They themselves are too afraid to try the sewers - there are stories of monsters living down there and he suspects the sewes are also how the undead got into the city undetected. 

He knows there are records of the extensive and labyrinthian sewer system at the great library, perhaps the PCs could find them there?

### Undead and City Watch Battle
A dozen guardsmen are stuck in battle with several dozen undead. Most are [zombies](bestiary/../../../../bestiary/undead/zombie.md), but some are [bloated shamblers](../../../bestiary/undead/bloated-shambler.md). 

If the PCs help, they'll be stuck in the battle, as well. If won, the guardsmen will patch up everyones wounds and continue their search for survivors to escort to the bastion. 

They offer the PCs a some of their medical supplies, as thanks for their help. 

### The Doom-Sayer
A madman is raving in the streets. Despite his loud screaming, the undead seem to pay him no heed. A collaborator? Perhaps even the undead prefer to pretend he wasn't there. He's running around, babbling, hollering and howling and may scream promises of doom at the PCs. 

### The Templar
A holy warrior who will attempt to recruit the PCs to help defend the temple, where survivors are huddled together, under the protection of the templars. 

If the PCs refuse, the templar may become violent towards them, cursing them for their vile selfishness and lack of solidarity. The PCs may talk themselves out of a fight, but the templar is a capable fighter who will be difficult to take on, even for a group of them. They may be able to run away from him, however. He is already tired and not particularly interested in chasing them down. 

### Haunted House
A larger manor provides some safety from the flames. But unbeknownst to the PCs, does a [haunt](../../../bestiary/undead/haunt.md) inhabit this place. 

Before the invasion, this restless soul was contained by the body of a servant of the house. They had always been poor, never known their parents and grew up at their parent's relatives, who didn't quite relish having another mouth to feed. This tragic life reached its crescendo in this fateful night, when their master told them they were no longer needed. In the exact moment that the pain set in, the invasion reached them. 

The overload of emotions of fear, anger and sorrow was too much for the soul. It simply could not depart, when it was time. Now, they want justice. Nothing more than justice. Their master must suffer equally, if this haunt is to be appeased. Trouble is, the master of the house has since joined the undead and is roaming the house aimlessly. 

Some undead roam the manor house, but most notably, the **haunt** drives anyone insane, who can't resist its influence. 

The manor house itself is only interesting because it provides some respite from the encroaching flames. But PCs should not dwell too long, for more undead are sure to sniff them out. There may be many valuables inside the house, but only few supplies of actual value. 

### The thoroughfare wargheist (cinematic)
A massive hulking beast roams the main thoroughfare, swiftly assaulting anyone foolish enough to cross its path with terrifying efficiency. 

A dozen guards are locked in a deadly struggle with the thing, but it is clearly winning the fight. 

There is no way for the PCs to fight this thing. It would obliterate them. This must be made clear, before they try to fight it. They could use the distraction to try and get past it, however. 

### Spine-Thresher (cinematic)
The PCs spot citizens stuck in a rapidly deacying, burning house. Before they can act, a charred [spine thresher](../../../bestiary/undead/spine-thresher.md) jumps from the flames out of sight and swiftly kills them. 

It turns to the PCs and moves to engage, when burning rubble comes crashing down on its head, burying it beneath. The PCs have time to flee and get away safely. They can't reach the monster. This is not meant to become a combat encounter. 

### Murder and terror (cinematic)
The PCs round a corner, to catch a glimpse of citizens being stabbed in the back and having their throats slit by bandits. 

There is no time for the PCs to prevent this. When the bandits notice the PCs and turn to face them, a [wargheist](../../../bestiary/undead/wargheist.md) comes crashing through a nearby building, obliterating it in the process. Frightened, the bandits scatter and the **wargheist** chases after them. It does not even pay attention to the PCs. 

There is no way for the PCs to fight the **wargheist**, it would obliterate them. This must be made clear, before they try to fight it. 

### A mage (cinematic)
As the PCs peek around a corner leading to the main thoroughfare, the see a robed and hooded figure calmly walking along. They're surrounded by a multitude of undead soldiers, who show no sign of hostility towards the figure. 

Then, suddenly, the figure points out into one alleyway along their path and several undead storm off into it. There are sounds of a short struggle and screams, before the alley falls silent, once again. 

Then the figure turns around and starts shooting a jet of flame from their hands, setting market stalls, carts and wagons aflame, as well as rekindling the fire on the buildings. 

There is no way for the PCs to get past them, here. They must find another way around. This must be made very clear. This is not intended to become a combat encounter.
