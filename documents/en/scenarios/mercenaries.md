# Mercenaries
The players start as part of a mercenary company, during the execution of a contract, as they are ambushed by the men they were hunting. Their party is almost fully destroyed. Only the players, the commander and three other companions survive, out of the former fifty members. 

After their defeat, the mercenaries need to retreat and reorganize. The commander is badly wounded, but alive. He names the player characters as his new officers, thus awarding them the right to counsel him and to command troops assigned to them.
