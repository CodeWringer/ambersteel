# Monster Hunters
As a troop of monster hunters, the players travel the world and take on contracts to kill certain, particularly troublesome beasts. 

This can be both in the old, as well as the new world. 

## What to expect
* Negotiating with potential contract-givers.
* Exploration. 
* Tracking, path-finding and survival in the wilds. 
* Research and preparation before a hunt.
