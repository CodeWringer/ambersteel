# Dragonroot
This very rare plant is a valuable find, to anyone who knows of its strengthening properties. 

It will knock out anyone who ingests it. But once they wake up again, a few hours later, they'll find their strength to have increased. 

## Appearance
A slightly iridescently shimmering moss with long stems once mature. 

## Occurrence
This plant only grows on soil stronlgy fertilized by dragon dung. Areas near a dragon's lair would have a decent chance of this plant growing there. 

## Life-cycle
In its infant stages, it firstly grows as a slightly iridescently shimmering moss. 

Once fully matured, it grows long grass like stems, within which the seeds are attached to a light, fluffy material. Once the bud opens, the wind can carry the seeds over great distances. Often, the seeds will get caught on dragon hide and thus be carried to fertile soil.
